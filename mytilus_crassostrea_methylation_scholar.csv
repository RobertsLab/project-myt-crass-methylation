Genome-wide and single-base resolution DNA methylomes of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas provide insight into the evolution of invertebrate CpG methylation,132,"Studies of DNA methylomes in a wide range of eukaryotes have revealed both conserved and divergent characteristics of DNA methylation among phylogenetic groups. However, data on invertebrates particularly molluscs are limited, which hinders our understanding of the evolution of DNA methylation in metazoa. The sequencing of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas genome provides an opportunity for genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in this model mollusc. Homologous searches against the C. gigas genome identified functional orthologs for key genes involved in DNA methylation: DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3, MBD2/3 and UHRF1. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) of the oyster’s mantle tissues revealed that more than 99% methylation modification was restricted to cytosines in CpG context and methylated CpGs accumulated in the bodies of genes that were moderately expressed. Young repeat elements were another major targets of CpG methylation in oysters. Comparison with other invertebrate methylomes suggested that the 5’-end bias of gene body methylation and the negative correlation between gene body methylation and gene length were the derived features probably limited to the insect lineage. Interestingly, phylostratigraphic analysis showed that CpG methylation preferentially targeted genes originating in the common ancestor of eukaryotes rather than the oldest genes originating in the common ancestor of cellular organisms. Comparative analysis of the oyster DNA methylomes and that of other animal species revealed that the characteristics of DNA methylation were generally conserved during invertebrate evolution, while some unique features were derived in the insect lineage. The preference of methylation modification on genes originating in the eukaryotic ancestor rather than the oldest genes is unexpected, probably implying that the emergence of methylation regulation in these 'relatively young’ genes was critical for the origin and radiation of eukaryotes.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/1471-2164-15-1119.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-15-1119,"Q Li, F Xu","Q Li:https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OvlnmcAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra

Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation and gene expression in Crassostrea gigas male gametes,98,"DNA methylation patterns and functions are variable across invertebrate taxa. In order to provide a better understanding of DNA methylation in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), we characterized the genome-wide DNA methylation profile in male gamete cells using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. RNA-Seq analysis was performed to examine the relationship between DNA methylation and transcript expression. Methylation status of over 7.6 million CpG dinucleotides was described with a majority of methylated regions occurring among intragenic regions. Overall, 15% of the CpG dinucleotides were determined to be methylated and the mitochondrial genome lacked DNA methylation. Integrative analysis of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq data revealed a positive association between methylation status, both in gene bodies and putative promoter regions, and expression. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the distribution of DNA methylation in the oyster male gamete tissue and suggests that DNA methylation is involved in gene regulatory activity.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00224/pdf,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00224/full,"CE Olson, SB Roberts","CE Olson:https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tKuF4OsAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra

DNA methylation patterns provide insight into epigenetic regulation in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas),206,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism with important regulatory functions in animals. While the mechanism itself is evolutionarily ancient, the distribution and function of DNA methylation is diverse both within and among phylogenetic groups. Although DNA methylation has been well studied in mammals, there are limited data on invertebrates, particularly molluscs. Here we characterize the distribution and investigate potential functions of DNA methylation in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Methylation sensitive PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR approaches were used to identify CpG methylation in C. gigas genes and demonstrated that this species possesses intragenic methylation. In silico analysis of CpGo/e ratios in publicly available sequence data suggests that DNA methylation is a common feature of the C. gigas genome, and that specific functional categories of genes have significantly different levels of methylation. The Pacific oyster genome displays intragenic DNA methylation and contains genes necessary for DNA methylation in animals.

DNA methylation mediates differentiation in thermal responses of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) derived from different tidal levels,71,"Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have the potential to affect organism acclimatization and adaptation to environmental changes by influencing their phenotypic plasticity; however, little is known about the role of methylation in the adaptive phenotypic divergence of marine invertebrates. Therefore, in this study, a typical intertidal species, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), was selected to investigate the epigenetic mechanism of phenotypic plasticity in marine invertebrates. Intertidal and subtidal oysters subjected to one-generation common garden experiments and exhibited phenotypic divergence were used. The methylation landscape of both groups of oysters was investigated under temperate and high temperature. The two tidal oysters exhibited divergent methylation patterns, regardless of the temperature, which was mainly original environment-induced. Intertidal samples exhibited significant hypomethylation and more plasticity of methylation in response to heat shock, while subtidal samples showed hypermethylation and less plasticity. Combined with RNA-seq data, a positive relationship between methylation and expression in gene bodies was detected on a genome-wide scale. In addition, approximately 11% and 7% of differentially expressed genes showed significant methylation variation under high temperatures in intertidal and subtidal samples, respectively. Genes related to apoptosis and organism development may be regulated by methylation in response to high temperature in intertidal oysters, whereas oxidation-reduction and ion homeostasis-related genes were involved in subtidal oysters. The results also suggest that DNA methylation mediates phenotypic divergence in oysters adapting to different environments. This study provides new insight into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity in adaptation to rapid climate change in marine organisms.",https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/pdf/41437_2020_Article_351.pdf,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-020-0351-7,,,… To compare plasticity of DNA methylation in response to … DNA methylation in oysters following heat stress.

General DNA Methylation Patterns and Environmentally-Induced Differential Methylation in the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica),47,"Epigenetic modification, specifically DNA methylation, is one possible mechanism for intergenerational plasticity. Before inheritance of methylation patterns can be characterized, we need a better understanding of how environmental change modifies the parental epigenome. To examine the influence of experimental ocean acidification on eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) gonad tissue, oysters were cultured in the laboratory under control (491 ± 49 μatm) or high (2550 ± 211 μatm) pCO2 conditions for four weeks. DNA from reproductive tissue was isolated from five oysters per treatment, then subjected to bisulfite treatment and DNA sequencing. Irrespective of treatment, DNA methylation was primarily found in gene bodies with approximately 22% of the genome predicted to be methylated In response to elevated pCO2 we found 598 differentially methylated loci primarily overlapping with gene bodies. A majority of differentially methylated loci were in exons (61.5%) with less intron overlap (31.9%). While there was though there was no evidence of a significant tendency for the genes with differentially methylated loci to be associated with distinct biological processes, the concentration of these loci in gene bodies, including genes involved in protein ubiquitination and biomineralization suggests DNA methylation may be important for transcriptional control in response to ocean acidification. Understanding how experimental ocean acidification conditions modify the oyster epigenome, and if these modifications are inherited, allows for a better understanding of how ecosystems will respond to environmental change.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00225/pdf,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00225/full,"YR Venkataraman, J Ries","YR Venkataraman:https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x9WA39wAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra

Epigenetic features in the oyster Crassostrea gigas suggestive of functionally relevant promoter DNA methylation in invertebrates,64,"DNA methylation is evolutionarily conserved. Vertebrates exhibit high, widespread DNA methylation whereas invertebrate genomes are less methylated, predominantly within gene bodies. DNA methylation in invertebrates is associated with transcription level, alternative splicing and genome evolution, but functional outcomes of DNA methylation remain poorly described in lophotrochozoans. Recent genome-wide approaches improve understanding in distant taxa such as molluscs, where the phylogenetic position and life traits of Crassostrea gigas make this bivalve an ideal model to study the physiological and evolutionary implications of DNA methylation. We review the literature about DNA methylation in invertebrates and focus on DNA methylation features in the oyster. Indeed, though our MeDIP-seq results confirm predominant intragenic methylation, the profiles depend on the oyster’s developmental and reproductive stage. We discuss the perspective that oyster DNA methylation could be biased toward the 5’-end of some genes, depending on physiological status, suggesting important functional outcomes of putative promoter methylation from cell differentiation during early development to sustained adaptation of the species to the environment.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00129/pdf,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00129/full,G Rivière,G Rivière:https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0iXF74wAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra,"… Regardless, we assume that dynamic genome-wide DNA methylation profiles are integrated through the canalization of random interactions with the surrounding molecular machinery …",7OuSH47hTv4J
Dynamics of DNA methylomes underlie oyster development,74,"DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic regulator of development in mammals and social insects, but its significance in development outside these groups is not understood. Here we investigated the genome-wide dynamics of DNA methylation in a mollusc model, the oyster Crassostrea gigas, from the egg to the completion of organogenesis. Large-scale methylation maps reveal that the oyster genome displays a succession of methylated and non methylated regions, which persist throughout development. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are strongly regulated during cleavage and metamorphosis. The distribution and levels of methylated DNA within genomic features (exons, introns, promoters, repeats and transposons) show different developmental lansdscapes marked by a strong increase in the methylation of exons against introns after metamorphosis. Kinetics of methylation in gene-bodies correlate to their transcription regulation and to distinct functional gene clusters, and DMRs at cleavage and metamorphosis bear the genes functionally related to these steps, respectively. This study shows that DNA methylome dynamics underlie development through transcription regulation in the oyster, a lophotrochozoan species. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such epigenetic regulation outside vertebrates and ecdysozoan models, bringing new insights into the evolution and the epigenetic regulation of developmental processes.",https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006807&type=printable,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006807,"G Riviere, S Tecchio, M Gras","G Riviere:https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0iXF74wAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra

Characterizing the Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Responses to Perkinsus marinus Infection in the Eastern Oyster Crassostrea virginica,27,"Eastern oyster populations in the northern Gulf of Mexico are routinely infected with the protistan parasite Perkinsus marinus, the cause of the disease commonly known as dermo. Recent experimental challenges among Atlantic coast populations have identified both resistant and susceptible genotypes using comparative transcriptomics. While controlled experimental challenges are essential first assessments, expanding this analysis to field reared individuals provides an opportunity to identify key genomic signatures of infection that appear both in the laboratory and in the field. In this study we combined reduced representation bisulfite sequencing with 3’ RNA sequencing (Tag-seq) to describe two molecular phenotypes associated with infection in oysters outplanted at a common garden field site. These combined approaches allowed us to examine changes in DNA methylation and gene expression for a large number of individuals (n=40) that developed infections during the course of a common garden outplant experiment. Our epigenetic analysis of DNA methylation identified significant changes in gene body methylation associated with increasing infection intensity, across genes associated with immune responses. There was a smaller transcriptomic response to increasing infection intensities with 32 genes showing differential expression, and 40 % of these genes were found to also be differentially methylated. While there was no clear pattern between direction of differential methylation and gene expression, there was a significant effect of percent methylation on gene-by-gene expression levels and the coefficient of variation in gene body methylation between treatments. These results show that heavily methylated genes have high levels of gene expression with low levels of variation. Comparing our differential expression results with previously published experimental P. marinus challenges identified overlapping expression patterns for genes associated with C1q-domain-containing and V-type proton ATPase proteins. Through our comparative transcriptomic approach using field reared individuals and co-expression network analysis we have also been able to identify a network of genes that change in expression in response to infection. These combined analyses provide evidence for a conserved response to P. marinus infections and suggest that gene body DNA methylation is a better predictor of gene expression variation than it is of the overall magnitude of gene expression.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00598/pdf,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00598/full,"KM Johnson, KA Sirovy","KM Johnson:https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=THvdzn4AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra

Differential DNA methylation in Pacific oyster reproductive tissue in response to ocean acidification,17,"Abstract Background There is a need to investigate mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in marine invertebrates as negative effects of climate change, like ocean acidification, are experienced by coastal ecosystems. Environmentally-induced changes to the methylome may regulate gene expression, but methylome responses can be species- and tissue-specific. Tissue-specificity has implications for gonad tissue, as gonad-specific methylation patterns may be inherited by offspring. We used the Pacific oyster ( Crassostrea gigas) — a model for understanding pH impacts on bivalve molecular physiology due to its genomic resources and importance in global aquaculture— to assess how low pH could impact the gonad methylome. Oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 ± 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 ± 0.02) conditions for seven weeks. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify methylated regions in female oyster gonad samples. C-&gt;T single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and removed to ensure accurate methylation characterization. Results Analysis of gonad methylomes revealed a total of 1,284 differentially methylated loci (DML) found primarily in genes, with several genes containing multiple DML. Gene ontologies for genes containing DML were involved in development and stress response, suggesting methylation may promote gonad growth homeostasis in low pH conditions. Additionally, several of these genes were associated with cytoskeletal structure regulation, metabolism, and protein ubiquitination — commonly-observed responses to ocean acidification. Comparison of these DML with other Crassostrea spp. exposed to ocean acidification demonstrates that similar pathways, but not identical genes, are impacted by methylation. Conclusions Our work suggests DNA methylation may have a regulatory role in gonad and larval development, which would shape adult and offspring responses to low pH stress. Combined with existing molluscan methylome research, our work further supports the need for tissue- and species-specific studies to understand the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation.

The association between DNA methylation and exon expression in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas,64,"Background 
DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic modifications of eukaryotic genomes and is believed to play integral roles in diverse biological processes Although DNA methylation has been well studied in mammals, data are limited in invertebrates, particularly Mollusca The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is an emerging genetic model for functional analysis of DNA methylation in Mollusca Recent studies have shown that there is a positive association between methylation status and gene expression in C gigas; however, whether this association exists at the exon level remains to be determined


Results 
In this study, we characterized the genome-wide methylation pattern across two different tissues of C gigas and found that methylated genes are expressed in more tissues and development stages than unmethylated genes Furthermore, we found that different types of exons had different methylation levels, with the lowest methylation levels in the first exons, followed by the last exons, and the internal exons We found that the exons included in the gene transcript contained significantly higher DNA methylation levels than skipped exons We observed that the DNA methylation levels increased slowly after the start sites and end sites of exons seperately, and then decreased quickly towards the middle sites of exons We also found that methylated exons were significantly longer than unmethylated exons

DNA methylation frequency and epigenetic variability of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in relation to the gametogenesis,16,"The origin and maintenance of sexual gametogenesis might provide insights into eukaryote evolution. Epigenetic variation of eukaryote well-being would provide clues that could relate ecological and evolutionary processes. To investigate the relationship between gametogenic variability and epigenetic polymorphism in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, DNA methylation differences were represented by analyzing genome-wide methylation patterns using the fluorescent-labeled methylation sensitive-amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP) technique. The C. gigas genome was widely methylated and marked variations in the pattern of methylation were shown during female and male gonad development. Statistically, the total methylation level increased from early developing stage to resorbing stage, from 28.86 to 34.53% in ovaries, while it increased from 31.20 to 35.46% in this period in testes. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean and principal coordinate analysis separated the C. gigas during female and male gonad development remarkably well, indicating remarkable differences across gametogenesis between ovaries and testes. Variation was higher in testes than in ovaries by the frequency based and multivariate analyses above. Both multivariate analyses and a significantly different population epigenetic structure suggested that a striking difference might exist across gametogenesis, reflecting a turning point of the methylation mechanism during reproductive progress.

Epigenetic variation mediated by lncRNAs accounts for adaptive genomic differentiation of the endemic blue mussel Mytilus chilensis,2,"Epigenetic variation affects gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence of genes controlling ecologically relevant phenotypes through different mechanisms, one of which is long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). This study identified and evaluated the gene expression of lncRNAs in the gill and mantle tissues of Mytilus chilensis individuals from two ecologically different sites: Cochamó (41°S) and Yaldad (43°S), southern Chile, both impacted by climatic-related conditions and by mussel farming given their use as seedbeds. Sequences identified as lncRNAs exhibited tissue-specific differences, mapping to 3.54 % of the gill transcriptome and 1.96 % of the mantle transcriptome, representing an average of 2.76 % of the whole transcriptome. Using a high fold change value (≥|100|), we identified 43 and 47 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) in the gill and mantle tissue of individuals sampled from Cochamó and 21 and 17 in the gill and mantle tissue of individuals sampled from Yaldad. Location-specific DE-lncRNAs were also detected in Cochamó (65) and Yaldad (94) samples. Via analysis of the differential expression of neighboring protein-coding genes, we identified enriched GO terms related to metabolic, genetic, and environmental information processing and immune system functions, reflecting how the impact of local ecological conditions may influence the M. chilensis (epi)genome expression.
