**Cover Story** ( [view full-size image](https://www.mdpi.com/files/uploaded/covers/foods/big_cover-foods-v10-i10.png)):

The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant impacts for nearly all industrial and societal sectors in the world. As closures and social distancing mandates were implemented to help control the spread of the novel coronavirus designated as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the food industry was immensely affected. This review explores the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chain from a multi-disciplinary viewpoint and provides perspectives on the consequences on food safety and food security, a risk assessment on human–animal interactions, and considers logistical/protocol adjustments required for the food industry.

The aim of this work concerns the manufacturing process of fresh egg tagliatelle labeled as a “source of fiber” based on tiger nut flour and wheat semolina. An attempt to improve the quality attributes and cooking properties of the obtained product was made by means of structuring agents. More specifically, a combination of three hydrocolloids (carboximethylcellulose, CMC; xanthan gum, XG; and locust bean gum, LBG) was tested. A Box–Behnken design with randomized response surface methodology was used to determine a suitable combination of these gums to achieve fewer cooking losses, higher water gain and swelling index values, and better texture characteristics before and after cooking. Positive effects on textural characteristics were observed when incorporating XG into the pasta formulation. Cooking and fiber loss also significantly diminished with the XG-CMC combination over 0.8%. No significant effect was found for the other evaluated parameters. A synergistic interaction between LBG and XG was only significant for the water absorption index. The cooked pasta was considered a source of fiber in all cases.

In this study, we chemically modified the short linear glucan (SLG) using the 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride to introduce a positive surface charge via cationization (CSLG). We then prepared CSLG-based binary nanocomplex particles through electrostatic interactions with low and high methoxyl pectin. The two new types of binary nanocomplex were comprehensively characterized. It was found that the nanocomplex particles showed a spherical shape with the particle size of <700 nm, smooth surface, homogeneous distribution, and negative surface charge. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that the driving forces to form nanocomplex were primarily electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. In addition, increasing the CSLG concentration in the nanocomplex significantly enhanced both thermal stability and digestive stability. By comparing the two complex nanoparticles, the HMP-CSLG has a larger particle size and better stability under the GI condition due to the high content of the methoxy group. Additionally, the HMP-CSLG nanoparticle has a higher encapsulation efficiency and slower release rate under simulated gastrointestinal fluid for tangeretin compared with the LMP-CSLG. These results provide new insights into designing the CSLG-based nanocomplex as a potential oral delivery system for nutraceuticals or active ingredients.

Single-dose coffee capsules have revolutionized the coffee market, fueling espresso coffee popularity and offering access to a wide selection of coffee blends. Nevertheless, scarce information related to coffee powder and brew’s combined volatile characterization is available. In this study, it is hypothesized that coffee brew aroma characteristics can be predicted based on coffee powder’s volatile composition. For this, headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry detection (GC × GC-ToFMS) was used. The data were combined via chemometric tools to characterize in depth the volatile composition of eight blends of capsule-coffee powder and respective espresso brews, simulating the consumer’s perception. A total of 390 volatile compounds were putatively identified, 100 reported for the first time in roasted coffee or brews. Although the same chemical families were determined among the coffee powders and espresso brews, a different volatile profile was determined for each matrix. The Pearson correlation of coffee powders and respective brews allowed to identify 15 volatile compounds, mainly terpenic and esters recognized by their pleasant notes, with a strong relationship between the amounts present in both matrices. These compounds can be key markers to predict the volatile aroma potential of an espresso brew when analyzing the coffee powder.

The use of wholemeal flour and sourdough fermentation in different food matrices has received considerable attention in recent years due to its resulting health benefits. In this study, a semolina-based and a wholemeal semolina-based sourdough were prepared and added to the formulation of gnocchetti-type fresh pasta. Four types of gnocchetti were made, using semolina plus semolina-based sourdough (SS), semolina plus wholemeal semolina-based sourdough (SWS), semolina alone (S), and semolina plus wholemeal semolina (WS). The latter two were used as controls. The digestibility of starch was studied both in vitro and in vivo, and the glycemic response (GR) and glycemic load (GL) were determined. Starch digestibility, both in vivo and in vitro, was higher in wholemeal semolina than semolina pasta and the resulting GR values (mg dL−1 min−1) were also higher (2209 and 2277 for WS and SWS; 1584 and 1553 for S and SS, respectively). The use of sourdough significantly reduced the rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content and increased the inaccessible digestible starch (IDS) content. The addition of sourdough to the formulation had no effect on the GR values, but led to a reduction of the GL of the pasta. These are the first data on the GR and GL of fresh pasta made with sourdough.

Hydrocolloids are commonly used in canned pet food. However, their functional effects have not been quantified in this food format. The objective was to determine the effects of select hydrocolloids on batter consistency, heat penetration, and texture of canned pet food. Treatments were added to the formula as 1% dextrose (D) and 0.5% guar gum with 0.5% of either dextrose (DG), kappa carrageenan (KCG), locust bean gum (LBG), or xanthan gum (XGG). Data were analyzed as a 1-way ANOVA with batch as a random effect and separated by Fisher’s LSD at _p_ < 0.05. Batter consistency (distance traveled in 30 s) thickened with increasing levels of hydrocolloids (thinnest to thickest: 23.63 to 2.75 cm). The D treatment (12.08 min) accumulated greater lethality during the heating cycle compared to all others (average 9.09 min). The KCG treatment (27.00 N) was the firmest and D and DG (average 8.75 N) the softest with LBG and XGG (average 15.59 N) intermediate. Toughness was similar except D (67 N·mm) was less tough than DG (117 N·mm). The D treatment showed the greatest expressible moisture (49.91%), LBG and XGG the lowest (average 16.54%), and DG and KCG intermediate (average 25.26%). Hydrocolloids influenced heat penetration, likely due to differences in batter consistency, and affected finished product texture.

In this study, the extraction conditions of bioactive aglycones from a celery extract supplemented with germinated soy were optimised by a response surface methodology. For subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis to enhance the apigenin content, increased production of its precursor apigetrin was firstly achieved through acidic extraction at optimal conditions, involving water at pH 1, at 75 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, a central composite design was conducted to analyse the pH (3–11) and temperature (25–35 °C) effects on the aglycone levels (apigenin, daidzein and genistein). The optimal extraction conditions were pH 7.02 and 29.99 °C, which resulted in a 40-fold increase in apigenin. The novel and cost-effective application of germinated soy β-glucosidase for the conversion of aglycones in non-soy foods is demonstrated. The enhanced bioactivities of aglycones may suggest potential applications for similar formulations as functional food ingredients.

A UV–Vis spectrophotometer and UPLC-DAD-QTOF/MS (TQ/MS) instruments were used for the identification and quantification of metabolites and antioxidant activity accordingly. The metabolites were quantified against their corresponding external standards. The contents of metabolites varied significantly among lettuce samples. Cyanidin 3- _O_-(6″- _O_-malonyl)glucoside (4.7~5013.6 μg/g DW), 2,3-di- _O_-caffeoyltartaric acid (337.1~19,957.2 μg/g DW), and quercetin 3- _O_-(6″- _O_-malonyl)glucoside (45.4~31,121.0 μg/g DW) were the most dominant in red pigmented lettuce samples among anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives, and flavonols, respectively. Lettuces with dark and very dark red pigmented leaves, circular leaf shape, a strong degree of leaf undulation, and highly dense leaf incisions were found to have high levels of flavonoids and hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives. Principal component analysis was used to investigate similarities and/or differences between samples, and the partial least square discriminant analysis classified them into known groups. The key variables that contributed highly were determined. Our report provides critical data on the bioactive constituents of red pigmented lettuce to breeders developing varieties with enhanced bioactive compounds and to nutraceutical companies developing nutrient dense foods and pharmaceutical formulations.

This study evaluated the effect of dry-aging on quality, palatability, and flavor-related compounds of pork loins. Ten pork loins were obtained at 7 days postmortem, divided into three equal portions, randomly assigned into three different aging methods (wet-aging (W), conventional dry-aging (DA), and UV-light dry-aging (UDA)), and aged for 21 days at 2 °C, 70% RH, and 0.8 m/s airflow. The results showed similar instrumental tenderness values across all treatments ( _p_ \> 0.05), while DA and UDA had a greater water-holding capacity than WA ( _p_ < 0.05). Both DA and UDA were observed to have comparable color stability to WA up to 5 days of retail display ( _p_ \> 0.05). Greater lipid oxidation was measured in both DA and UDA at the end of display compared to WA ( _p_ < 0.05). The UV light minimized microorganisms concentration on both surface and lean portions of UDA compared to other treatments ( _p_ < 0.05). The consumer panel was not able to differentiate any sensory traits and overall likeness between the treatments ( _p_ \> 0.05). Metabolomics analysis, however, identified more flavor-related compounds in dry-aged meat. These findings suggested that dry-aging can be used for pork loins for value-seeking consumers, as it has a potential to generate unique dry-aged flavor in meat with no adverse impacts on meat quality and microbiological attributes.

Mexico is the center of origin and diversification of domesticated _chile_ ( _Capsicum annuum_ L.). _Chile_ is conceived and employed as both food and medicine in Mexico. In this context, the objective of this paper is to describe and analyze the cultural role of _chile_ as food and as medicine for the body and soul in different cultures of Mexico. To write it, we relied on our own fieldwork and literature review. Our findings include a) the first matrix of uses of _chile_ across 67 indigenous and Afrodescendants cultures within Mexican territory and b) the proposal of a new model of diversified uses of _chile_. Traditional knowledge, uses and management of _chile_ as food and medicine form a continuum (i.e., are not separated into distinct categories). The intermingled uses of _Capsicum_ are diversified, deeply rooted and far-reaching into the past. Most of the knowledge, uses and practices are shared throughout Mexico. On the other hand, there is knowledge and practices that only occur in local or regional cultural contexts. In order to fulfill food, medicinal or spiritual functions, native communities use wild/cultivated _chile_.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of extruded and fermented wheat bran (WBex-f) to the quality of wheat bread (BR), including the volatile compounds (VC) profile and VC relationship with emotions induced for consumers. A comparison study of BR (prepared with 5%, 10%, and 15% untreated wheat bran (nWB) and WBex-f) quality parameters was performed. It was established that nWB increases dough hardness and reduces BR specific volume. The addition of 5% and 10% of WBex-f was not significant on BR porosity and led to the formation of a high number of large pores. nWB and WBex-f increases the mass loss of BR after baking (by 13.38%), and the control breads showed the highest crust darkness, yellowness, and redness. nWB and WBex-f reduces BR firmness during storage, and WBex-f increases the overall acceptability (OA) of BR (by 26.2%). A strong positive correlation was found between OA and the emotion ‘happy’ (r = 0.8696). In BR prepared with WBex-f, a higher content of pyrazine, methyl-; pyrazine, 2-ethyl-; pyrazine, 2-ethyl-6-methyl-; furfural; ethanone, 1-(2-furanyl)-; benzaldehyde; and 3-furanmethanol was found. Finally, it can be stated that WBex-f could prolong the shelf life of BR and leads to the formation of a specific VC profile, which is associated with a higher OA of the product.

_Anethum graveolens_ L. (dill seeds) are important medicinal and functional foods in Europe and central and south Asia, often used as a seasoning in daily diets. _Anethum graveolens_ L. seeds (AGS) are used to treat indigestion and have shown physiological activities such as those against hypoglycemia and gastroesophageal disease. This study explored the protective effects of AGS extract on mucosal damages and inflammation in reflux esophagitis rats. AGS inhibited cellular inflammation including NO production and the expression of inflammatory proteins (iNOS and COX2 etc.), cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and nuclear transfer factor related to NF-κB signaling caused by LPS stimulation in vitro. Furthermore, reflux esophagitis-induced rats were used to observe the anti-inflammatory effect of AGS. Tissue staining and inflammation-related protein expression of rats with acute reflux esophagitis indicated that AGS improved this inflammatory response, such as COX-2 and TNF-α in mucosa. In conclusion, AGS have good physiological activity and the possibility of being used as a medicinal food and a functional resource for the prevention and therapy of gastroesophageal diseases.

The scope of this paper was to investigate the effects of water distribution differences on the quality and feasibility of chicken patties supplemented with woody breast (WB). Chicken patties, containing differing amounts of WB (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) were analyzed using low-field NMR. Quality differences between chicken patties were further evaluated by combining lipid and protein properties, fry loss (FL), color (L\*, a\*, b\*), texture (hardness, springiness, chewiness, cohesiveness, resilience), microstructure, and sensory characteristics. The results expressed that both lipid and protein oxidation increased and immobilized water in chicken patties can be converted to free water more easily with increasing levels of WB. Additionally, the free water ratio decreased, water freedom increased, and the bound water ratio increased ( _p_ < 0.05). Fry loss, color, texture (hardness, springiness, chewiness), microstructure, and sensory (character, organization, taste) characteristics deteriorated significantly when the WB inclusion level exceeded 25%. Particularly, characteristics of texture (chewiness and character) and sensory (character and organization) decreased significantly as WB inclusion increased past 25% ( _p_ < 0.01). Furthermore, fry loss, texture, and overall microstructure partially confirmed the moisture variation of chicken patties as the potential cause of the abnormal quality. Although the experimental data expressed that mixing to 35% WB inclusion was feasible, the practical and economic impact recommends inclusion levels to not exceed 30%.

The attention of some winemakers and researchers over the past years has been drawn towards the partial or total dealcoholization of wines and alcoholic beverages due to trends in wine styles, and the effect of climate change on wine alcohol content. To achieve this, different techniques have been used at the various stages of winemaking, among which the physical dealcoholization techniques, particularly membrane separation (nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporative perstraction, and pervaporation) and thermal distillation (vacuum distillation and spinning cone column), have shown promising results and hence are being used for commercial production. However, the removal of alcohol by these techniques can cause changes in color and losses of desirable volatile aroma compounds, which can subsequently affect the sensory quality and acceptability of the wine by consumers. Aside from the removal of ethanol, other factors such as the ethanol concentration, the kind of alcohol removal technique, the retention properties of the wine non-volatile matrix, and the chemical-physical properties of the aroma compounds can influence changes in the wine sensory quality during dealcoholization. This review highlights and summarizes some of the techniques for wine dealcoholization and their impact on wine quality to help winemakers in choosing the best technique to limit adverse effects in dealcoholized wines and to help meet the needs and acceptance among different targeted consumers such as younger people, pregnant women, drivers, and teetotalers.

The physico-chemical properties (proximate, salt content, water activity (aw), pH) and lipid oxidation of droëwors (dried salted/spiced meat sausages) produced with zebra meat and different sheep fat levels (10, 15, and 20% by weight) measured at day 0 (before drying), day 2 (after drying at 30 °C and 40% relative humidity), and over a 90 day storage (day 17, 32, 47, 62, 77, and 92) under vacuum at 25 °C were investigated. The use of lower fat levels (10 and 15%) in the formulation resulted in higher weight loss during drying and droëwors with higher protein, ash, and salt content and lower aw and pH compared to the droëwors made with 20% fat. The pH increased ( _p_ < 0.001) during storage for all the fat levels, while the moisture content and the aw were stable as expected. TBARS values were the highest in droëwors made with 20% of fat after drying (day 2), but droëwors made with 10% of fat reached similar maximal values on day 17. Formulations containing 15% sheep fat displayed the lowest TBARS values after drying and along storage, and thus had the best characteristics in relation to oxidative stability.

Recently, many bioactive peptides have been identified using bioinformatics tools. Previously, our group developed a method to screen dual-functional peptides that have direct intestinal delivery with porous silica gel and bile acid micelle disruption. However, newly designed peptides were not found in any storage protein. Therefore, in this study, in silico screening was performed using a 350,000 edible peptide library consisting of 4- to 7-mer independent peptides. As an initial screening, all edible peptides were applied to the random forest model to select predicted positive peptides. For a second screening, the peptides were assessed for the possibility of intestinal delivery using a 3D color map. From this approach, three novel dual-functional peptides, VYVFDE, WEFIDF, and VEEFYC were identified, and all of them were derived from storage proteins (legumin, myosin, and 11S globulin). In particular, VEEFYCS, in which a serine residue (S) is added to VEEFYC, was assumed to be released by thermolysin from the 11S-globulin derived from _Ginkgo biloba_ by LC-MS/MS analysis. VEEFYCS was found to have suitable direct intestinal delivery and bile acid micelle disruption activity.

Dietary acrylamide formed during baking and frying of plant-based foods such as bread and other cereal products, coffee, fried potatoes, and olives is reported to induce genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic, and antifertility properties in vivo, suggesting the need to keep the acrylamide content low with respect to widely consumed heat-processed food including flatbreads. Due to the fact that pigmented corn flours contain biologically active and health-promoting phenolic and anthocyanin compounds, the objective of this study was to potentially define beneficial properties of flatbread by evaluating the acrylamide content determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) with a detection limit of 1.8 µg/kg and proximate composition by standard methods of six experimental flatbreads made from two white, two blue, one red, and one yellow corn flours obtained by milling commercial seeds. Acrylamide content was also determined in experimental flatbreads made from combinations in quinoa flour, wheat flour, and peanut meal with added broccoli or beet vegetables and of commercial flatbreads including tortillas and wraps. Proximate analysis of flatbreads showed significant differences in protein and fat but not in carbohydrate, mineral, and water content. The acrylamide content of 16 evaluated flatbreads ranged from 0 to 49.1 µg/kg, suggesting that these flatbreads have the potential to serve as low-acrylamide functional foods. The dietary significance of the results is discussed.

The subject of food–medicines (foods ingested in order to obtain a therapeutic activity or to prevent diseases) is garnering increasing attention from both ethnobiologists and ethnopharmacologists as diet-related chronic diseases are one of the major problems resulting in a large proportion of deaths globally, which calls for interest from the scientific community to make sensible decisions in the field of food and medicine. In this regard, the current study is an important attempt at providing baseline data for developing healthy and curative food ingredients. This study aimed at recording the culinary and medicinal uses of wild food plants (WFPs) in the remote Mastuj Valley, located at the extreme north of Chitral District, Pakistan. An ethnobotanical survey was completed via 30 in-depth semi-structured interviews with local knowledge holders to record the food and medicinal uses of WFPs in the study area. A total of 43 WFPs were recorded, most of which were used as cooked vegetables and raw snacks. Leaves were the most frequently used plant part. A remarkable proportion (81%) of use reports for the recorded wild plant taxa were quoted as food–medicines or medicinal foods, while very few were reported as either food or medicines, without any relationship between uses in these two domains. Previous ethnomedicinal studies from nearby regions have shown that most of the recorded wild plants have been used as medicines, thus supporting the findings of the current study. A literature survey revealed that many of the reported medicinal uses (33%) for the quoted WFPs were not verifiable on PubMed as they have not been studied for their respective medicinal actions. We observed that most of the plants quoted here have disappeared from the traditional food and medicinal system, which may be attributed to the invasion of the food market and the prevalence of allopathic medicine. However, knowledge of these wild plants is still alive in memory, and women are the main holders of cultural knowledge as they use it to manage the cooking and processing of WFPs. Therefore, in this context, we strongly recommend the preservation of local biocultural heritage, promoted through future development and educational programs, which could represent a timely response to the loss of cultural and traditional knowledge.

The present study examines the impacts of supplementing yogurt with 1% whey protein concentrate (WPC), Ca-caseinate (Ca-CN) and Spirulina platensis on the physiological performance of V-line rabbits receiving diets containing yogurt (at a dose of 5 g/kg body weight/day) and the different meat quality aspects. The results show that fat content was highest ( _p_ < 0.05) in yogurt fortified with Spirulina powder, but protein (%) was highest in yogurt enriched with WPC. Yogurt containing Spirulina powder showed a significant ( _p_ < 0.05) increase in total antioxidant activity. The final live body weight for G1 was higher than the other groups. However, additives affected the saddle, hind legs, liver and neck percentages significantly ( _p_ < 0.05). There were not significant differences for all groups in the forelegs, lung and heart percentages. LDL-cholesterol, total protein, globulin, albumin, creatinine and immunoglobulin M values were lowest ( _p_ < 0.05) in the WPC group. Significant improvements appeared in the small intestinal wall, microbiology, growth performance, serum biochemistry, organ histology and meat quality of the group receiving enriched yogurt. Yogurts enriched with WPC, Ca-CN and _Spirulina platensis_ can be used as functional foods.

Food enriched with probiotics and prebiotics belong to the class of novel foods. Functional food, apart from its nutritional function, has an additional pro-health effect. The aim of the presented study was to create a concept of a functional dessert—avocado-based non-diary ice cream enriched with probiotic bacteria _Lactiplantibacillus plantarum_ 299v. The product was tested for the survival of bacteria in various conditions, and the influence of the probiotic on the physicochemical and organoleptic properties of non-dairy ice cream was assessed. The dessert with probiotic throughout the storage period (8 weeks) kept the therapeutic minimum defined for probiotic food products. It was found that the addition of the probiotic did not deteriorate either the color or the sensory profile of the dessert. There was also no increase in the redox potential nor the acidity of the product with the addition of a probiotic.

Here, we explored the influences of thyme microcapsules on the growth, gene expression, and histamine accumulation by _Proteus bacillus_ isolated from smoked horsemeat sausage. RT-qPCR was employed to evaluate the gene expression level of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) cascade-associated genes. We used HPLC to monitor histamine concentration both in pure culture as well as in the processing of smoked horsemeat sausage. Results showed that histamine accumulation was suppressed by thyme microcapsule inhibitory effect on the histamine-producing bacteria and the reduction in the transcription of hdcA and hdcP genes. Besides, compared with thyme essential oil (EO), thyme microcapsules exhibited higher antibacterial activity and had a higher score for overall acceptance. Therefore, the addition of thyme microcapsules in Xinjiang smoked horsemeat sausage inhibits histamine accumulation.

Increased focus towards food safety and quality is reshaping food purchasing decisions around the world. Although some food attributes are visible, many of the attributes that consumers seek and are willing to pay a price premium for are not. Consequently, consumers rely on trusted cues and information to help them verify the food quality and credence attributes they seek. In this study, we synthesise the findings from previous research to generate a framework illustrating the key trust influencing factors that are beyond visual and brand-related cues. Our framework identifies that consumer trust in food and the food system is established through the assurances related to individual food products and the actors of the food system. Specifically, product assurance builds consumer trust through food packaging labels communicating food attribute claims, certifications, country or region of origin, and food traceability information. In addition, producers, processors, and retailers provide consumers with food safety and quality assurances, while government agencies, third-party institutions, advocacy groups, and the mass media may modify how labelling information and food operators are perceived by consumers. We hope our framework will guide future research efforts to test these trust factors in various consumer and market settings.

Fava bean ( _Vicia faba_ L.) is a promising source of proteins that can be potentially used as nutritional and/or functional agents for industrial food applications. Fava ingredients are industrially produced, modified, and utilized for food applications. Their processing conditions influence physico-chemical protein properties that further impact ingredient functionality. To design a functionally suitable ingredient, an understanding of the interrelationships between different properties is essential. Hence, this work aimed to assess two statistical analytical tools, Pearson’s correlation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), for investigating the role of the process conditions of fava ingredients on their functional and protein properties. Fava concentrates were processed by pH (2, 4, 6.4 and 11), temperature (55, 75 and 95 ∘∘C) and treatment duration (30 and 360 min) into different modified ingredients. These were utilized under two application conditions (pH 4 and 7), and their foam and emulsion properties as well as their ingredient characteristics (charge, solubility, and intrinsic fluorescence) were measured. The results show that foam and emulsion properties are not correlated to each other. They are associated with different protein and non-protein attributes as fava concentrate is a multi-component matrix. Importantly, it is found that the results from the two statistical tools are not fully comparable but do complement each other. This highlights that both statistical analytical tools are equally important for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of process conditions on different properties and the interrelationships between them. Therefore, it is recommended to use Pearson’s correlation and principal component analysis in future investigations of new plant-based proteins.

Recently, kimchi has been recognized as a healthy food worldwide, prompting increased interest in its health benefits and quality characteristics. Although commercial kimchi is manufactured in various countries, little is known about quality differences between the kimchi from different countries. To clarify differences in quality characteristics, minerals, free sugars, organic acids, free amino acids, and volatile compounds, commercial kimchi manufactured in Korea, China, and the United States were investigated. The composition of the microbial community and antioxidant activity were compared. Mineral and free sugar contents were high in Korean commercial kimchi, while the organic acid content was relatively low. The free amino acid content was markedly higher in Korean kimchi than that in kimchi manufactured in China and the United States. In addition, the volatile compound content differed between the kimchi produced in different countries. Considering the microbial communities, _Leuconostoc_ and _Weissella_ were more abundant in commercial kimchi from Korea than that from China or the United States. Commercial kimchi in Korea showed the highest antioxidant activity. These results support the high quality and antioxidant activity of commercial kimchi manufactured in Korea, emphasizing its importance in the global kimchi industry.

For long heather honey has been a special variety due to its unique organoleptic characteristics. This study aimed to characterize and optimize the isolation of the dominant volatile fraction of Greek autumn heather honey using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The described approach pointed out 13 main volatile components more closely related to honey botanical origin, in terms of occurrence and relative abundance. These volatiles include phenolic compounds and norisoprenoids, with benzaldehyde, safranal and _p_-anisaldehyde present in higher amounts, while ethyl 4-methoxybenzoate is reported for the first time in honey. Then, an experimental design was developed based on five numeric factors and one categorical factor and evaluated the optimum conditions (temperature: 60 °C, equilibration time: 30 min extraction time: 15 min magnetic stirrer velocity: 100 rpm sample volume: 6 mL water: honey ratio: 1:3 ( _v_/ _w_)). Additionally, a validation test set reinforces the above methodology investigation. Honey is very complex and variable with respect to its volatile components given the high diversity of the floral source. As a result, customizing the isolation parameters for each honey is a good approach for streamlining the isolation volatile compounds. This study could provide a good basis for future recognition of monofloral autumn heather honey.

The ability to accurately measure the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in complex matrices is essential. A problem encountered when using spectrophotometric methods is interference due to ascorbic acid (AA), often used as an enzyme “protecting agent” during PPO extraction. This study focuses on the nature of AA’s effect on spectrophotometric determinations of PPO activity as well as enzyme extraction. Potato extracts and semi-purified PPO were used as enzyme sources. The inactivation of PPO attributed to AA is substrate-mediated. The extent of AA-dependent inactivation of PPO in model systems varied between substrates. AA only slows mechanism-based inactivation of PPO induced by catechol, possibly owing to the prevention of quinone formation. AA minimally protects PPO activity during enzyme extraction. The problem associated with AA in PPO assay could be circumvented by using ascorbate oxidase to remove AA when catechol is the primary substrate or by using chlorogenic acid as the primary substrate.

In order to explore the changes and properties of high-purity insoluble dietary fiber from okara (HPIDF) after entering the colon and be fermented by colonic flora, fermented high-purity insoluble dietary fiber (F-HPIDF) was obtained by simulated fermentation in vitro by HPIDF and colonic flora from C57BL/6 mice. For exploring the differences of HPIDF and F-HPIDF, the changes of structure (SEM. FTIR, XRD, particle size, specific surface area, monosaccharide composition) and adsorption properties (water, oil, heavy metal irons, harmful substances) of HPIDF/F-HPIDF were explored. The results showed that F-HPIDF had a higher water-holding capacity (19.17 g/g), water-swelling capacity (24.83 mL/g), heavy metals-adsorption capacity (Cd2+: 1.82 μmol/g; Pb2+: 1.91 μmol/g; Zn2+: 1.30 μmol/g; Cu2+: 0.68 μmol/g), and harmful substances-adsorption capacity (GAC: 0.23 g/g; CAC: 14.80 mg/g; SCAC: 0.49 g/g) than HPIDF due to the changes of structure caused by fermentation. In addition, with the fermentation of HPIDF, some beneficial substances were produced, which might be potential intestinal prebiotics. The study of F-HPIDF strengthens the speculation that HPIDF may have potential bioactivities after entering the colon, which proved that okara-HPIDF may have potential functionality.

During pregnancy, women exposed to microbiological risks are more susceptible to contracting specific pathogens, which can lead to serious diseases both in the mother and the foetus. Food-borne diseases can be avoided to a large extent by following good practices of food manipulation and cooking. Safe eating behaviours are influenced by knowledge and perception of food risks and are constructed, among others, online. Pregnant women often use Web 2.0 to obtain and share pregnancy-related information as a strategy of collective coping with emotions through conversations. This paper explores how knowledge and perceptions of food risks during pregnancy are shared among users on Italian Facebook pages and groups. The corpus, including 648,399 items (i.e., posts), was analysed: (a) first, by means of the Reinert method, to verify to what extent issues concerning food risks are debated; and (b) second, through a manual content analysis, to observe how food risks are addressed in terms of contents and social sharing of emotions. The main results show that food risk is not among the most discussed topics, and the least known and debated food risks are the most widespread (e.g., campylobacteriosis). Sometimes, food risks, when addressed, were minimised or denied, and the belief to be ‘less at risk’ than peers for such risk (i.e., optimistic bias) was observed. The results underline the importance, for health institutions, of building a tailored communication strategy on food risks during pregnancy to promote correct food behaviours by exploiting social networks.

Food analysis based on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is simple, sensitive and rapid, but requires a costly colorimetric instrument. The aim of this work was to develop a portable, low-cost and user-friendly colorimetric instrument for colorimetric ELISA and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) detection. The principle of the developed instrument was employing a light-emitting diode to generate the signal light and using a light-dependent resistor to measure the signal light absorbed by the oxidized 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine. The absorption spectra revealed that the solution absorbed signal light more strongly after reaction with H2SO4, and blue light would be favorably absorbed. Evaluations on the stability and accuracy of the instrument and interference from ambient light showed that the fabricated instrument was stable, accurate, capable of quantitative detection and insensitive to ambient light changes. In addition, this instrument is user-friendly since it could calculate and report the final amount of AFB1 to the operator. Measurements of maize and peanuts showed that the instrument provided as accurate results as the professional equipment. With the low fabrication cost (about RMB 129 or USD 20), portability, and user-friendliness, this instrument presents attractive potential in the rapid detection of AFB1.

Brown seaweeds have shown high potential of bioactivity and provide health benefits as an important functional food ingredient. Therefore, four abundantly growing tropical brown seaweeds— _Iyengaria stellata, Spatoglossum asperum_, _Sargassum linearifolium_, and _Stoechospermum polypodioides_—were collected from the Saurashtra Coast of the Arabian Sea. They were analyzed for metabolite profiling, biochemical activities (including total antioxidant, reducing, scavenging, and anti-proliferative characteristics), and total phenolic and flavonoid contents. A concentration-dependent antioxidant, reducing, and scavenging activities were observed for all four brown seaweeds. The _S. asperum_ and _I. stellata_ extracts showed maximum total antioxidant activity. _S. asperum_ also showed high scavenging and reducing activities compared to other studied brown seaweeds. Further, _S. asperum_ contained high total phenolic and flavonoid content compared to other brown seaweeds collected from the same coast. A multivariate correlation study confirmed a positive correlation between total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and biochemical activities (total antioxidant, scavenging and reducing) for all brown seaweeds. About 35% anti-proliferative activity was observed with _S. asperum_ extract on Huh7 cells; in contrast _S. polypodioide_ showed about 44% proliferation inhibition of Huh7 cells. Similarly, 26% proliferation inhibition of HeLa cells was observed with _S. asperum_ extract. Overall, _S. asperum_ possesses high total flavonoid and phenolic amounts, and showed potential antioxidant, scavenging and reducing characteristics. The study confirmed the nutraceutical potential of _S. asperum_ and that it could be a promising functional food ingredient.

Soybean oil is the second most exported oil from the United States and South America, and is widely marketed as a cooking oil product containing numerous health benefits for human consumers. However, culinary oils with high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents, are known to produce high quantities of lipid oxidation products (LOPs), including toxic aldehydes upon exposure to high-temperature frying episodes. Previous studies have demonstrated causal links between aldehyde ingestion and inhalation with deleterious health perturbations, including mutagenic and carcinogenic effects, along with cardiovascular and teratogenic actions. In this study, aldehydic LOPs were detected and quantified in commercially available samples of soybean, avocado, corn and extra-virgin olive oil products before and after their exposure to laboratory-simulated laboratory frying episodes (LSSFEs) using high-resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Results acquired demonstrated that PUFA-rich soybean and corn oils gave rise to the highest concentrations of oil aldehydes from the thermo-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, whereas monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-laden avocado and olive oils were much more resistant to this peroxidation process, as expected. Multivariate chemometrics analyses provided evidence that an orthogonal component pattern of aldehydic LOPs featuring low-molecular-mass n-alkanals such as propanal, and 4-oxo-alkanals, arises from thermo-oxidation of the ω-3 fatty acid (FA) linolenic acid (present in soybean oils at levels of ca. 7% ( _w_/ _w_)), was able to at least partially distinguish this oil from corresponding samples of thermally-stressed corn oil. Despite having a similar total PUFA level, corn oil has only a negligible ω-3 FA content, and therefore generated significantly lower levels of these two aldehyde classes. In view of the adverse health effects associated with dietary LOP ingestion, alternative methodologies for the incorporation of soybean oils within high-temperature frying practices are proposed.

## Abstract  ![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)  AI

The SLC family of transporters plays a critical role in nutrient and ion transport across cellular membranes in teleost fish. This paper explores the diversity and evolution of the SLC transporter family in teleosts, discussing their functional implications in physiological processes such as osmoregulation, nutrient uptake, and drug metabolism. By examining various SLC genes, their expression patterns, and evolutionary history, this study provides insights into how teleost fish adapt to diverse aquatic environments.

[Tiziano Verri](https://independent.academia.edu/TizianoVerri)

The Journal of Physiology, 2013

Human genes for passive, ion-coupled transporters and exchangers are included in the so-called solute carrier (SLC) gene series, to date consisting of 52 families and 398 genes. Teleost fish genes for SLC proteins have also been described in the last two decades, and catalogued in preliminary SLC-like form in 50 families and at least 338 genes after systematic GenBank database mining (December 2010–March 2011). When the kinetic properties of the expressed proteins are studied in detail, teleost fish SLC transporters always reveal extraordinary ‘molecular diversity’ with respect to the mammalian counterparts, which reflects peculiar adaptation of the protein to the physiology of the species and/or to the environment where the species lives. In the case of the H+–oligopeptide transporter PEPT1(SLC15A1), comparative analysis of diverse teleost fish orthologs has shown that the protein may exhibit very eccentric properties in terms of pH dependence (e.g. the adaptation of zebrafish PEPT1 to alkaline pH), temperature dependence (e.g. the adaptation of icefish PEPT1 to sub-zero temperatures) and/or substrate specificity (e.g. the species-specificity of PEPT1 for the uptake of l-lysine-containing peptides). The revelation of such peculiarities is providing new contributions to the discussion on PEPT1 in both basic (e.g. molecular structure–function analyses) and applied research (e.g. optimizing diets to enhance growth of commercially valuable fish).

[T. Verri](https://unile.academia.edu/TVerri)

Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology, 2018

Teleost fish are excellent models to study the phylogeny of the slc34 gene family, Slc34-mediated phosphate (P i) transport and how Slc34 transporters contribute P i homeostasis. Fish need to accumulate P i from the diet to sustain growth. Much alike in mammals, intestinal uptake in fish is partly a paracellular and partly a Slc34-mediated transcellular process. Acute regulation of P i balance is achieved in the kidney via a combination of Slc34-mediated secretion and/or reabsorption. A great plasticity is observed in how various species perform and combine the different processes of secretion and reabsorption. A reason for this diversity is found in one or two whole genome duplication events followed by potential gene loss; consequently, teleosts exhibit distinctly different repertoires of Slc34 transporters. Moreover, due to habitats with vastly different salinity, teleosts face the challenge of either preserving water in a hyperosmotic environment (seawater) or excreting water in hypoosmotic freshwater. An additional challenge in understanding teleost P i homeostasis are the genome duplication and retention events that diversified peptide hormones such as parathyroid hormone and stanniocalcin. Dietary P i and non-coding RNAs also regulate the expression of piscine Slc34 transporters. The adaptive responses of teleost Slc34 transporters to e.g. P i diets and vitamin D are informative in the context of comparative physiology, but also relevant in applied physiology and aquaculture. In fact, P i is essential for teleost fish growth but it also exerts significant adverse consequences if over-supplied. Thus, investigating Slc34 transporters helps tuning the physiology of commercially valuable teleost fish in a confined environment.

The workshop series is reliant on the support of corporate and agency sponsors and I thank the Fisheries Research & Development Corporation for their continued support of the ASFB workshops. FRDC was again the Principal Sponsor for the 2006 workshop, along with twelve Major Sponsors and seven other Sponsors. 2006 also represented the milestone of 35 years since the Society was formed. In 1971 the ASFB started with 79 members, and has now grown to in excess of 500 active members. The strength of the Society is in its membership, and I encourage all members to actively participate in the business of the ASFB. This means not just attending the workshops and conferences, but also participation in the various committees and at the AGM.

American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, 2009

Sulfate (SO42−) is the second most abundant anion in seawater (SW), and excretion of excess SO42−from ingested SW is essential for marine fish to survive. Marine teleosts excrete SO42−via the urine produced in the kidney. The SO42−transporter that secretes and concentrates SO42−in the urine has not previously been identified. Here, we have identified and characterized candidates for the long-sought transporters. Using sequences from the fugu database, we have cloned cDNA fragments of all transporters belonging to the Slc13 and Slc26 families from mefugu ( Takifugu obscurus ). We compared Slc13 and Slc26 mRNA expression in the kidney between freshwater (FW) and SW mefugu. Among 14 clones examined, the expression of a Slc26a6 paralog (mfSlc26a6A) was the most upregulated (30-fold) in the kidney of SW mefugu. Electrophysiological analyses of Xenopus oocytes expressing mfSlc26a6A, mfSlc26a6B, and mouse Slc26a6 (mSlc26a6) demonstrated that all transporters mediate electrogenic Cl−/SO42−,...

These results extend the species' previously known distribution area but also suggest contemporary local extinctions. Further research and conservation efforts are thus urgently needed to monitor the extant populations and unveil the species' habitat requirements, biology, and genetic parameters of diversity and structure.

The establishment of invading organisms in natural ecosystems is one of the most serious environmental issues. In Brazil, the invasive species Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857), the golden mussel, is a mollusk capable of causing major changes in water systems, generating social and economic impacts, given its biofouling capacity. Limnoperna fortunei can easily block pipes and heat exchangers in the water systems of hydroelectric power plants due to its ability to strongly adhere to the substrate using its byssus-a bundle of filaments secreted by these animals. Therefore, the early detection of this invader is essential for management actions to be immediate, in order to control population growth rate at the beginning of the invasive process, preventing this environment from serving as a source for new infestations. The implantation of a method that integrates the active monitoring of prioritized areas, laboratory techniques, including molecular biology methods, and the sharing of hydrographic data between basin managers and users for early detection of the presence of species in Brazilian waters appears as an efficient option to prevent and control invasions.
