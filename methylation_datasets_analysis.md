## Critical Evaluation

##### Strengths
The datasets represent comprehensive coverage of different analytical approaches, from genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to targeted methylation-sensitive techniques. Multiple species within both genera are represented, and studies cover various biological contexts including development, environmental stress, and population variation.

##### Limitations
Many studies lack complete database accession information, making data accessibility challenging. Some datasets focus on specific tissues or conditions, limiting broader applicability. The methodological approaches vary significantly between studies, potentially affecting comparability.

## Implications & Examples

These datasets have established that DNA methylation in bivalves primarily occurs in gene bodies rather than promoters, contrasting with vertebrate patterns [2]. The data support roles for methylation in environmental adaptation, sex determination, immune responses, and development. For aquaculture applications, these datasets provide baseline information for understanding how environmental stressors affect epigenetic regulation in commercially important species.
