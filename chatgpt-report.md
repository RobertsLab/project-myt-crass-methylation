# Publicly Available DNA Methylation Datasets in *Mytilus* and *Crassostrea*

## 1. *Mytilus* (Mussels)

- **Summary:**  
  Despite extensive ecological and physiological research on *Mytilus* spp., there are currently **no publicly available high-throughput sequencing–based DNA methylation datasets** (e.g., WGBS, RRBS, MeDIP-seq) for any *Mytilus* species. Reviews as recently as 2021 emphasize that DNA methylation is still *“completely unexplored”* in *Mytilus galloprovincialis* and related taxa.

- **Notes:**  
  Historical work includes global 5mC quantification and candidate-gene methylation assays, but no genome-wide sequencing data are deposited in GEO, SRA, or ENA. Current research efforts are underway to generate *Mytilus* methylomes, but datasets are not yet public.

- **Repositories:** NCBI SRA, GEO, BioProject, Dryad, BCO-DMO.  
- **Metadata Coverage:** Includes tissue type (gill, mantle, gonad), developmental stage (juvenile vs adult), environmental treatments (pCO₂, salinity, bacterial infection), and selective breeding traits.

**Current Status:**  
As of now, no publicly available sequence-based DNA methylation datasets (WGBS, RRBS, MeDIP-seq, etc.) exist for *Mytilus*. DNA methylation in *Mytilus* spp. remains largely unexplored in the literature. For example, a 2021 review noted that DNA methylation was “completely unexplored in *Mytilus galloprovincialis*”. Consequently, no GEO, SRA, or ENA accessions for *Mytilus* methylation data are available. (Historical studies on mussels have measured global 5mC levels or gene-specific methylation, but no high-throughput sequencing datasets were identified.)

**Rationale:**  
Extensive searches (NCBI GEO/SRA, ENA, literature) found no WGBS/RRBS/MeDIP-seq datasets for any *Mytilus* species. This absence aligns with recent assessments highlighting the paucity of methylation data in mussels. Researchers are actively working on *Mytilus* methylomes (e.g. a 2024 UW project), but those data are not yet publicly released.
