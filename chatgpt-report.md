DNA Methylation Datasets for Mytilus and Crassostrea

Genus Mytilus (Mussels)

Current Status: As of now, no publicly available sequence-based DNA methylation datasets (WGBS, RRBS, MeDIP-seq, etc.) exist for Mytilus. DNA methylation in Mytilus spp. remains largely unexplored in the literature ￼. For example, a 2021 review noted that DNA methylation was “completely unexplored in Mytilus galloprovincialis” ￼. Consequently, we found no GEO, SRA, or ENA accessions for Mytilus methylation data in connected sources. (Historical studies on mussels have measured global 5mC levels or gene-specific methylation, but no high-throughput sequencing datasets were identified.)

Rationale: We performed extensive searches (NCBI GEO/SRA, ENA, literature) and found no WGBS/RRBS/MeDIP-seq datasets for any Mytilus species. This absence aligns with recent assessments highlighting the paucity of methylation data in mussels ￼. Researchers are actively working on Mytilus methylomes (e.g. a 2024 UW project), but those data are not yet publicly released.

Genus Crassostrea (Oysters)

In contrast, multiple Crassostrea species have publicly archived DNA methylation datasets. Below we list all known sequence-based methylation datasets (with method, tissue, and accession):
	•	Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) – Gill WGBS (Genome-Wide Bisulfite-Seq): The first base-resolution methylome for any mollusk was generated for C. gigas gill tissue ￼ ￼. Gavery & Roberts (2013) deposited the WGBS data in NCBI’s SRA (Sequence Read Archive) under accession SRX327373 ￼. This dataset maps ~2.5 million CpGs in the oyster genome ￼, revealing predominantly gene-body methylation. Metadata: Adult gill tissue; combined MBD-enrichment and bisulfite sequencing ￼; linked to gene expression data.
	•	Pacific Oyster – Mantle WGBS (Inbred vs Wild): Wang et al. (2014) profiled DNA methylation in mantle tissue of an inbred lab strain vs. a wild oyster ￼. The raw WGBS data for those two oysters are on NCBI GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) under series GSE40302 (samples GSM991064 “Inbred” and GSM991065 “Wild”) ￼. This dataset provided single-base methylomes, confirming >99% CpG-context methylation and gene-body enrichment ￼. Metadata: WGBS (Illumina HiSeq) on mantle DNA from a fourth-generation inbred oyster and a wild oyster ￼, enabling comparative methylome analysis ￼.
	•	Pacific Oyster – WGBS under Experimental Conditions: C. gigas methylomes have also been generated for specific traits and stressors. For example, Tan et al. (2022) performed WGBS on two selectively bred strains (fast-growth vs. normal, different shell color) ￼ ￼. Similarly, Li et al. (2024) profiled methylation changes after Vibrio bacterial infection (hemocyte WGBS). These studies’ sequence data are archived in SRA (accession IDs in their publications). For instance, Tan et al. report 339,604 DMCs between strains ￼, with data likely in CNSA/NCBI (though specific accession was not found in connected text). Metadata: WGBS on somatic tissues under breeding or immune challenge conditions, illustrating methylation’s role in growth ￼ and pathogen response.
	•	Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) – Gonad MBD-BSseq (Ocean Acidification experiment): Lotterhos et al. (2019) characterized methylation in gonad tissue of Eastern oysters exposed to control vs high pCO₂ (acidified) water for 4 weeks. They used MBD-enrichment followed by bisulfite sequencing (MBD-BSseq) on 5 oysters per treatment. The raw sequence data (paired-end 100 bp, Illumina HiSeq1500) are available via BioProject PRJNA513384 ￼ (NCBI SRA; also archived with BCO-DMO as dataset 785167 with DOI:10.1575/1912/bco-dmo.785167.1). This dataset revealed ~22% of CpGs methylated in the oyster genome and identified ~598 differentially methylated loci under high CO₂ ￼ ￼. Metadata: Adult gonad tissue, experimental OA exposure vs control; part of the “Epigenetics to Ocean” project ￼ ￼.
	•	Eastern Oyster – RRBS and Tag-Seq (Common Garden experiment): Johnson et al. (2022) examined gene body methylation via RRBS (reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing) in 80 juvenile C. virginica from 6 families, reared at two Gulf of Mexico sites (high vs low salinity) ￼. They deposited processed methylation data on Dryad (DOI:10.5061/dryad.q573n5tk4) ￼. Only ~1.4% of CpG sites showed differential methylation between environments ￼, indicating genetic factors outweighed environmental effects on the methylome. Paired gene expression (Tag-seq) data are included in the Dryad package ￼. Metadata: RRBS libraries of gill tissue DNA from common-gardened juveniles (raw reads available via Dryad/NOAA repository; coverage matrices provided) ￼ ￼.
	•	Eastern Oyster – WGBS (Transgenerational studies): Ongoing projects have applied WGBS to C. virginica in larval and adult stages. For example, one study mapped methylation in larvae vs zygotes to investigate inheritance (Roberts Lab “CEASMALLR” project, 2024). Another (Venkataraman et al., 2020) looked at paternal effects on C. gigas larvae methylation. While these data are referenced in literature, their raw datasets are typically included in the above BioProjects or available upon request in repositories. (No additional distinct GEO/SRA IDs were found via our searches beyond those listed above.)

In summary, Crassostrea oysters have several publicly available DNA methylation datasets – notably two WGBS datasets for C. gigas (GEO GSE40302 ￼; SRA SRX327373 ￼) and two for C. virginica (OA gonad MBD-BSseq, PRJNA513384 ￼; common-garden RRBS, Dryad DOI:10.5061/dryad.q573n5tk4 ￼). These include associated metadata such as tissue type (gill, mantle, gonad), environmental conditions (wild vs lab, pCO₂ treatment, salinity), developmental stage, and even phenotype (growth rate, strain). No methylation array data were found for these genera, consistent with the question’s focus on sequence-based assays.
