## Abstract

### Background

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism with important regulatory functions in animals. While the mechanism itself is evolutionarily ancient, the distribution and function of DNA methylation is diverse both within and among phylogenetic groups. Although DNA methylation has been well studied in mammals, there are limited data on invertebrates, particularly molluscs. Here we characterize the distribution and investigate potential functions of DNA methylation in the Pacific oyster ( _Crassostrea gigas_).

### Results

Methylation sensitive PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR approaches were used to identify CpG methylation in _C. gigas_ genes and demonstrated that this species possesses intragenic methylation. _In silico_ analysis of CpGo/e ratios in publicly available sequence data suggests that DNA methylation is a common feature of the _C. gigas_ genome, and that specific functional categories of genes have significantly different levels of methylation.

### Conclusions

The Pacific oyster genome displays intragenic DNA methylation and contains genes necessary for DNA methylation in animals. Results of this investigation suggest that DNA methylation has regulatory functions in _Crassostrea gigas_, particularly in gene families that have inducible expression, including those involved in stress and environmental responses.

## Background

Epigenetic mechanisms induce changes in gene activity without alteration to the underlying DNA sequence \[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B1)\]. Common epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA activity. The most well-studied of these is DNA methylation, which refers to the addition of a methyl group to position 5 of cytosines. In animals, this reaction is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (DNMTs) and occurs almost exclusively in CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is typically associated with transcriptional repression, and is primarily achieved by methylation in gene promoters \[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B2)- [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B4)\]. The functional significance of DNA methylation in vertebrates includes providing genomic stability \[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B5)\], regulation of imprinted genes \[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B6)\] and X-chromosome inactivation \[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B7)\]. In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for development and cell differentiation \[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B8)\] and defects or unintended changes in DNA methylation can have deleterious consequences such as embryonic lethality \[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B9)\] and tumorgenesis \[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B10)\]. DNA methylation, like many epigenetic marks, may be heritable, therefore unintended changes as a result of environmental exposures or other processes can be passed on for multiple generations \[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B11)\].

The extent of cytosine methylation varies considerably among eukaryotes. In vertebrates, approximately 70-80% of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are methylated \[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B12)\], a pattern referred to as global methylation. Invertebrates display a wide range of DNA methylation, from very limited methylation in _Drosophilia melanogaster_\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B13)\] and _Caenorhabditis elegans_\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B14)\] to a mosaic pattern of methylation in the sea urchin ( _Strongylocentrotus purpuratus_) \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B15)\] and _Ciona intestinalis_\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B16), [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B17)\]. Bird and Taggart \[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B12)\] concluded that there were three general types of methylation patterns: the 'insect-type' which shows little to no methylation, the 'echinoderm-type', the genomes of which contain both methylated and non-methylated fractions, and the heavily methylated 'vertebrate-type'. Recent studies in the honey bee ( _Apis mellifera_) indicate these patterns may be more complex \[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B18), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B19)\]. In contrast to _D. melanogaster_, which lacks most of the classical DNMTs \[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B20)\] and shows limited cytosine methylation \[ [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B21)\], _A. mellifera_ has a fully functional set of DNA methylation enzymes and shows substantial methylation across its genome \[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B18)\].

In vertebrates, regulation of transcription by DNA methylation is accomplished by differential patterns of methylation in intergenic regions, namely gene promoters \[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B2)- [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B4)\]. In contrast, there are no significant differences reported in the methylation status of gene promoters in invertebrates, where methylation appears to be targeted specifically to transcription units \[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B17), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B22)\]. Computational analyses of the methylation status of _A. mellifera_ genes have provided some of the first evidence supporting a regulatory role of intragenic DNA methylation in invertebrates \[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B19), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B23)\]. In these studies, genes associated with general metabolic or 'housekeeping' functions were predicted to be hyper-methylated, whereas caste-specific genes were preferentially hypo-methylated. This functional clustering suggests DNA methylation serves to regulate gene transcription in _A. mellifera_, however, it is uncertain if this function is conserved across invertebrate taxa. Furthermore, it is unclear exactly how intragenic cytosine methylation directly affects transcription.

Studies in _A. mellifera_ and others illustrate the diversity of DNA methylation patterns in invertebrate taxa and highlight gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary and functional significance of DNA methylation. One taxonomic group that has been notably absent from these investigations is the phylum Mollusca. Molluscs were first categorized as having 'echinoderm-type' DNA methylation patterns based on experimental evidence using the common mussel ( _Mytilus edulis_) \[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B12)\]. Since then, there has been little investigation of DNA methylation in molluscs with the exception of evidence suggesting the presence CpG methylation in the clam, _Donux truculus_\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B24)\]. In addition to increasing our understanding of the evolution of DNA methylation in invertebrate taxa, this study provides an opportunity to evaluate the Pacific oyster ( _Crassostrea gigas_) as a model organism for analyzing DNA methylation in an aquatic species. Bivalve molluscs are important bioindicators \[ [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B25)\] and elucidating the functional significance of DNA methylation in these organisms may prove valuable for understanding the effects of environmental stress in aquatic organisms. Here, we report the first investigation into DNA methylation profiles in the genome of the Pacific oyster. We confirm the presence of intragenic CpG methylation in _C. gigas_. We also demonstrate a relationship between predicted methylation status and gene function, suggesting that DNA methylation performs important regulatory functions in _C. gigas_. Implications of these findings are discussed in both an evolutionary and ecological context.

## Results

### Methylation Sensitive PCR

A Methylation Sensitive PCR (MSP) approach was used to identify specific methylated sites. Five genes associated with immune function were analyzed and methylation status determined (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#T1)). Methylation status can be concluded based on the presence or absence of a PCR product in the methylation sensitive HpaII digest. Of the five genes analyzed, CpG methylation was confirmed for _heat shock protein 70_( _hsp70_), whereas no methylation was detectable at restriction site(s) for the other sequences examined. The CpG observed to expected ratios (see Methods for calculation) are included in Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#T1) for each gene. It should be noted that _hsp70_ has the lowest ratio of all the genes analyzed (0.57). This low ratio is predictive of a hyper-methylated status, which is confirmed here by MSP.

Results of methylation status of five genes associated with immune response by MSP. PCR was carried out on undigested, HpaII digested, and MspI digested DNA. Presence (+) or absence (-) of PCR product is indicated. Number of CCGG restriction sites in the indicated sequence and CpGo/e ratios are also provided.

### Bisulfite Sequencing PCR

In order to describe methylated cytosines outside of CCGG sites, Bisulfite Sequencing PCR (BSP) was used. Five genes predicted to be hyper-methylated, and five predicted to be hypo-methylated (based on CpG observed to expected ratio) were randomly selected for analysis. Valid PCR products were produced for two of the genes. This is a typical result as the conversion of unmethylated cytosines results in challenges for primer specificity. Four individual clones were sequenced for each of the two products. There was a 100% conversion rate for non-CpG cytosines for each of the clones sequenced. In the first fragment, a 136 bp fragment with homology to the amino terminal fragment of the human neuromedin-u receptor \[Swiss-Prot: [Q9GZQ4""](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9GZQ4)\], one of seven CpGs sites displayed methylation in 25% of the clones sequenced (Figure [1(a)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#F1)). In a second fragment, one of two CpGs sites was determined to be methylated in 50% of the clones sequenced in a 93 bp region (Figure [1(b)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#F1)). The latter sequence has significant homology to human bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain, 1A \[Swiss-Prot: [Q9NRL2](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9NRL2)\].

Solid and open circles represent methylated and non-methylated CpG dinucleotides, respectively.

### _In Silico_ Analysis of _C. gigas_ Transcriptome

The ratio of observed to expected CpG dinucleotides (CpGo/e) was used to predict methylation status in the _C. gigas_ transcriptome. This approach is based on the known hyper-mutability of methylated cytosines, which readily deaminate to thymine residues \[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B26)\]. This CpG mutation is not easily corrected by DNA repair machinery, and as a result consistently methylated regions of DNA are depleted of CpG dinucleotides over evolutionary time \[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B27)\]. Consequently, regions of DNA with a low CpGo/e are predicted to be methylated, whereas regions with a high CpGo/e (approaching 1.0) are predicted to be unmethylated. This approach has been used to reliably predict methylation status across many taxonomic groups \[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B17), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B19), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B22), [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B28)\].

A non-redundant _C. gigas_ contig database, 'GigasDatabase' version 6 \[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B29)\] was utilized for this analysis. To ensure only CpG (and not GpC) dinucleotides were being evaluated, analysis was limited to annotated sequences. The probability density function of the CpGo/e for 12,210 annotated _C. gigas_ expressed sequence tag (EST) contigs is illustrated in Figure [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#F2). We find that the data fit a bimodal mixture model (blue curve) significantly better than a unimodal distribution. The red curves represent the scaled, normal mixture components, which have means of 0.40 (± 0.12 SD) and 0.70 (± 0.21 SD) respectively (Figure [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#F2)). A majority of the contigs have a CpGo/e less than 1.0.

**Distribution of predicted methylation status of 12,210 annotated _C. gigas_ transcripts measured computationally by CpGo/e ratio**. Probability density function of CpGo/e for 12,210 _C. gigas_ contigs. Blue curve is fitted mixture model; red curves are scaled, normal mixture components with means of 0.40 and 0.70 respectively. For contrast, a control dinucleotide (GpCo/e) is also shown with the blue curve representing a normal, unimodal distribution (inset).

The ratio of observed to expected GpC dinucleotide frequencies (GpCo/e) was calculated in order to be assured that the bimodal distribution of CpGo/e was not biased toward G+C content of specific genes as there are no known mechanisms for preferential depletion of the GpC dinucleotide. As predicted, the ratio of observed to expected GpC's approaches 1.0 following a unimodal Gaussian distribution (Figure [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#F2) inset). In addition, there is a significant negative correlation between CpGo/e and TpGo/e (p = 0.00) indicating that the depletion of CpG dinucleotides is associated with the conversion of methylated CpG sites to TpG dinucleotides.

In order to determine any functional difference that may exist among those genes with lower than expected CpGo/e ratios, data were analyzed in the context of each gene's biological process GO Slim term (Figure [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#F3)). Several biological processes have CpGo/e ratios that are significantly different from each other (see Additional file [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#S1): Matrix of p-values for comparisons between GO Slim categories based on CpGo/e). Specifically, genes with lower CpGo/e ratios (predicted to be hyper-methylated) were associated with DNA metabolism, RNA metabolism, and cell cycle and proliferation. Biological processes with higher CpGo/e ratios (predicted to be hypo-methylated) include cell adhesion, cell-to-cell signalling and signal transduction. This analysis confirms that the normal mixture components described previously in Figure [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#F2) are enriched with genes from particular functional categories.

## Discussion

Results of methylation specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR indicate that the Pacific oyster ( _Crassostrea gigas_) genome is methylated. Further evidence supporting the presence and importance of methylation in _C. gigas_ is the identification of genes that encode DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), the family of proteins responsible for the enzymatic conversion of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. Animals that lack DNA methylation such as _C. elegans_ also lack essential DNMTs, while invertebrates with an intermediate level of DNA methylation such as honey bees, sea urchins and urochordates have the full set of DNMT genes \[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B30)\]. Sequences with high homology to DNMT3 (responsible for _de novo_ methylation), DNMT1 (associated with maintenance methylation), and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (mediation of the effects of DNA methylation) are present in a publicly available _C. gigas_ contig database, GigasDatabase version 6 \[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B29)\]. These annotated sequences can be found in GigasDatabase with accession numbers [CU684371](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CU684371).p.cg.6 (e-value 1e-61), [CU994437](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CU994437).p.cg.6 (e-value 2e-26), and [AM861084](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AM861084).p.cg.6 (e-value 1e-11), respectively. While a DNMT2 homolog has not been identified, it may not be required for DNA methylation in _C. gigas_ as it functions primarily as a tRNA methyltransferase and shows only weak DNA methyltransferase activity _in vitro_\[ [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B31)\]. DNMTs are an evolutionarily conserved group of proteins, but show structural diversity both within and among taxa \[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B32)\]. The evolutionary diversity of DNA methylation within and among phylogenetic groups provides justification for further evaluation of the functions of this epigenetic mark.

The presence of intragenic methylation in _C. gigas_ is similar to that of other invertebrates that primarily exhibit intragenic DNA methylation patterns \[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B33), [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B17)\], the roles of which have been largely unexplored. Studies of DNA methylation in mammals have generally focused on promoter regions, where hyper-methylation of promoters inhibits initiation of transcription \[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B2)\]. In contrast, invertebrate genomes do not show differentially methylated gene promoters \[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B22)\]. One of the long-standing hypotheses is that intragenic DNA methylation prevents inappropriate initiation of transcription outside of promoter regions \[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B34)\]; however new studies have begun to investigate a more active role for intragenic DNA methylation, namely in regulation of expression. For example, exonic DNA methylation has been shown to regulate transcription of the _phytochrome A_ gene in _Arabidopsis thaliana_\[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B35)\]. In humans, investigation of intragenic CpG islands (≥ 200 bp regions with G+C content of at least 50% and CpGo/e close to expected) has revealed that CpG islands in terminal exons may regulate transcription of non-coding RNAs \[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B36)\]. Here, using BSP, we observed methylation variability in two CpG sites that may indicate cell-specific methylation. The function of intragenic DNA methylation in _C. gigas_ cannot be conclusively determined from this study, but results of studies in other organisms suggest that it could be involved in either repression of transcription outside of transcription start sites and/or regulation of expression.

Within the transcriptome of the Pacific oyster, a significant difference in methylation pattern was observed across gene families. A majority of _C. gigas_ genes analyzed were depleted in CpG dinucleotides (i.e. CpGo/e < 1.0) and show a significantly bimodal distribution, suggesting that DNA methylation is a common feature of the _C. gigas_ transcriptome, and that certain groups of genes have significantly different levels of methylation. The bimodal distribution of CpGo/e is similar to the pattern observed in the honey bee _A. mellifera_, where authors reported a hyper-methylated fraction that was enriched in genes involved with general metabolic functions and a hypo-methylated fraction enriched with genes that are associated with caste-specific functions \[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B19)\]. Similarly when _C. gigas_ transcripts were clustered according to their functional annotations using GO Slim terms, we see that the two distributions are comprised of functionally distinct classes of genes with varying regulatory requirements. Specifically, genes predicted to be hyper-methylated are associated with housekeeping functions and those predicted to be hypo-methylated are associated with general immune functions. Hyper-methylation of intragenic regions of housekeeping genes is consistent between _C. gigas_ and _A. mellifera_\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B19)\], but stands in contrast to observations in vertebrates, where distinct hypo-methylation of housekeeping gene promoters is associated with global expression \[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B37)\]. Constitutive DNA methylation in housekeeping genes in _C. gigas_ could be important for repressing transcription outside of promoter regions as previously discussed. It has also been proposed that hyper-methylation of housekeeping genes in _A. mellifera_ indicates epigenetic control of gene activity in housekeeping genes \[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B23)\]. Further experiments will be required to determine whether hyper-methylation of housekeeping genes plays a passive role in preventing inappropriate transcription or a more active role in maintaining expression in _C. gigas_.

Highest CpGo/e ratios were observed in genes involved in the oyster's innate immune response, including categories of cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling, and signal transduction. Our experimental data using MSP supports the predicted hypo-methylation of this class of genes as only 1 of the 5 immune related genes were methylated. Our results do not indicate that DNA methylation is entirely absent from genes in the hypo-methylated group as CpG depletion is still observed (CpGo/e 0.7) which stands in contrast to the hypo-methylated genes in _A. mellifera_(CpGo/e >1.0). One explanation as to why it would be advantageous for this class of genes to be hypo-methylated is that it allows for greater epigenetic flexibility and higher regulatory control. Oysters have been shown to have high phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental changes and stress \[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B38), [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B39)\] and it could be postulated that an epigenetic mark, such as DNA methylation, could provide this level of control. DNA methylation has been generally considered to be a less dynamic epigenetic mark, however, it has been reported in plants that DNA methylation levels are involved in regulating gene expression in response to stress and show active methylation and demethylation in response to various stressors \[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B40)- [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B42)\]. It has been hypothesized from these studies that DNA methylation is a possible mechanism to impart protection against local stresses in future generations \[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B43)\]. The identification of genes involved in demethylation in _C. gigas_ would be an important step toward uncovering the nature of these epigenetic marks.

DNA methylation patterns have been shown to be heritable in mammalian taxa \[ [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B44)\], and changes in DNA methylation patterns can persist for multiple generations \[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B45)\]. Little work has been done to investigate heritability of DNA methylation in invertebrates, although a recent study of the crustacean, _Daphnia magna_, has shown transgenerational heritability of DNA methylation patterns after exposures to 5-azacytidine \[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B46)\]. If DNA methylation does play a role in regulation of transcription in _C. gigas_ it may provide a mechanism not only for regulating responses to stress, but also for adapting to local stressors through heritability of DNA methylation patterns. Investigating the potential of epigenetic control in mechanisms of local adaptation may prove useful in understanding impacts of anthropogenic inputs in aquatic ecosystems and populations. Likewise, it is possible that epigenetic mechanisms may provide an explanation for other phenomena associated with heritability such as inbreeding depression and hybrid vigour.

Elucidating functional significance of DNA methylation in aquatic invertebrates may change the way we study impacts of environmental change in aquatic organisms. A range of factors such as diet \[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B47), [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B48)\], xenobiotic chemicals \[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B49)\], and endocrine disruptors \[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B11)\] have been shown to disrupt DNA methylation patterns. These epigenetic disruptions are increasingly associated with disease susceptibility, which in some cases can be passed on for multiple generations \[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B50)\]. Although these investigations have been performed almost exclusively in mammalian species, recent studies have reported a dose dependent relationship between concentration of mercury and cadmium and total DNA methylation in _D. magna_\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B46), [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B51)\]. Understanding which environmental factors can affect DNA methylation and elucidating the functional significance of DNA methylation in these important bioindicator species will be major steps toward clarifying the complex interactions between the environment, gene expression, and organismal responses.

## Conclusions

The Pacific oyster genome displays methylation. _In silico_ analysis reveals intragenic regions are targeted for methylation consistent with reports of methylation in other invertebrate species. Results of this investigation suggest that DNA methylation has regulatory functions in _Crassostrea gigas_, particularly in gene families involved in stress and environmental response. Experiments are underway in our lab to investigate relationships between the environment, DNA methylation, and control of gene expression to better characterize this process. In-depth analysis of methylation patterns in _Crassostrea gigas_, will help to advance the field of evolutionary epigenetics and will serve to illuminate functions of DNA methylation in invertebrates.

## Methods

### Animal collection & DNA isolation

Oysters used in this study were collected from naturalized _C. gigas_ populations in Puget Sound, Washington. To isolate genomic DNA, 25 mg of gill tissue was processed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA).

### Methylation Sensitive PCR

Oyster genomic DNA was enzyme digested with either HpaII or MspI. Five immune related genes containing one or more CCGG recognition sites and covering a broad range of predicted methylation status (based on CpGo/e) were selected from a set of ESTs generated from a cDNA library of plated hemocytes \[ [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B52)\]. PCR primers were designed to flank one or more restriction sites. Primer sequences are provided in Additional file [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#S2): Primer Sequences. Quantitative PCR was performed using digested (HpaII or MspI) and undigested samples using 1× Immomix Master Mix (Bioline USA Inc., Boston, MA), 2 uM SYTO-13 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 0.2 uM forward and reverse primers in an Opticon 2 System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with the following cycling conditions: 10 min at 95C, followed by 37 cycles of 15 sec at 95C, 30 sec at 55C, and 1 min at 72C and a final extension at 72C for 10 min. Results were scored qualitatively based on the presence or absence of amplification as determined by fluorescence.

### Bisulfite Conversion and Sequencing

Genomic DNA was bisulfite converted using the Epitect Bisulfite conversion kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 1.75 ug of DNA was subjected to treatment with sodium bisulfite at increased temperature to deaminate unmethylated cytosine residues to uracil. Following treatment, the solution was desulfonated on a column, washed and eluted.

To identify methylated cytosines in expressed regions of the oyster genome, Meth Primer \[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B53)\] was used to design primers that flank multiple CpG sites, but do not contain CpGs. Primer sequences are provided in Additional file [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#S2): Primer Sequences. The mean expected amplicon length for bisulfite primers was ~180 bp. PCR of bisulfite treated samples (54 ng/PCR reaction) was carried out using Taq DNA Polymerase Master Mix (Apex BioResearch Products, Research Triangle Park, NC) for 10 min at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95 C, 30 sec at 55 C, and 1 min at 72C and a final extension at 72C for 10 min.

PCR products were separated using gel electrophoresis. Single bands were excised from the gel, purified using Ultra-DA purification columns (Ambion, Foster City, CA) and cloned using TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). Four clones were sequenced for each primer pair. Methylation status was determined by comparing the sequence of bisulfite treated DNA to sequence of untreated DNA using Geneious 4.5.4 software (Biomatters Ltd., Aukland, NZ) and annotated using BLAST \[ [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B54)\].

### _In Silico_ Analysis: Predicted DNA Methylation Status

For _in silico_ analysis, the non-redundant _C. gigas_ expressed sequence tag (EST) contig database, 'GigasDatabase' version 6 ( [http://public-contigbrowser.sigenae.org:9090/Crassostrea\_gigas/index.html](http://public-contigbrowser.sigenae.org:9090/Crassostrea_gigas/index.html), \[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B29)\]), was utilized. Analysis was limited to annotated sequences (n = 12,210) in order to be confident that sequences were reported in the 5' to 3'direction. It should be noted that this transcriptomic dataset is appropriate for predicting methylation status of the _C. gigas_ genome as investigation into other invertebrate species shows that DNA methylation is specifically targeted to transcribed regions of the genome \[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B17), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B12)\].

CpG observed/expected ratio (CpGo/e) was calculated using the following equation where _l_ is the number of nucleotides in the contig:

|     |
| --- |
| CpGo/e=numberofCpGnumberofC×numberofG×l2l−1 |

To evaluate the distribution of Pacific oyster contigs, a mixture model was fit to the CpGo/e ratios using the mixtools package \[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B55)\] in R \[ [56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B56)\] yielding a two component mixture where _p_ 1 \+ _p_ 2 = 1\. Hence the data C_i_, are distributed as:

|     |
| --- |
| Ci~p1N(μ1,σ1)+p2N(μ2σ2). |

The log likelihood statistic of the bimodal mixture model was compared to the normal null model to test for a significant improvement in fit.

In order to evaluate the variation of CpGo/e within and among functional classes of genes, contigs from the GigasDatabase annotated with a biological process GO term (n = 10,699 contigs) were assigned a functional group based on the MGI GO Slim database [http://www.informatics.jax.org](http://www.informatics.jax.org/)\[ [57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996979/#B57)\]. Since each contig may have multiple GO terms, contigs were allowed to fall into multiple GO Slim bins. However, to avoid weighting within a single category, an individual contig was not allowed to be included more than once in a single GO Slim bin. The mean CpGo/e and standard errors were calculated for each GO Slim term. A one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test for multiple comparisons was performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A significance level of p < 0.05 was accepted.

## Abstract

### Background

European flat oysters ( _Ostrea edulis_) are sequential hermaphrodites that alternate sex in response to environmental change. Epigenetics, including DNA methylation, are often involved in sex reversal through influencing gene transcription. Knowledge on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying sex reversal in hermaphrodite bivalves is limited to gonadal tissue and previous studies have only compared DNA methylomes of males and females. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess whether sex-specific DNA methylation can be identified in somatic gill tissue of the flat oyster.

### Results

By comparing whole-genome methylomes of 35 oysters of different sex phenotypes using nanopore sequencing, we demonstrate the presence of sex-specific DNA methylation patterns in somatic gill tissue. A total of 9,654 regions and 2,576 genes were differentially methylated between male, female, and hermaphrodite oysters. Functional analysis of differentially methylated genes indicated an association with energy homeostasis and metabolic processes, implying a remodeling of the energy balance.

### Conclusions

This study is the first to characterize DNA methylomes of hermaphrodite oysters, providing new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying sex reversal in a sequential hermaphrodite invertebrate. Additionally, this study characterizes sex-specific DNA methylation in somatic gill tissue, paving the way for non-lethal sex identification using epigenetic biomarkers.

## Introduction

Epigenetic mechanisms influence gene transcription without changing the DNA sequence itself \[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR1)\]. DNA methylation, the covalent transfer a methyl group to a DNA nucleotide, is one of the most common epigenetic modifications in eukaryotes and is involved with various developmental and regulatory processes \[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR3)\]. In vertebrates, DNA methylation occurs primarily on CpG islands where de-methylation often results in gene silencing \[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR5)\]. Contrasting to vertebrates, invertebrates acquire a more mosaic pattern of DNA methylation, mainly occurring on gene bodies \[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR6), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR7)\]. Reduced gene body methylation has the potential to facilitate transcriptional opportunities by alternative splicing, for example through exon skipping or by providing access to alternative transcription start sites \[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR7), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR8)\]. Growth, development, and environmental conditions can initiate de novo DNA methylation or change its maintenance \[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR4), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR9)\]. By influencing gene transcription, DNA methylation forms the crucial ingredient in facilitating phenotypic plasticity, whereby organisms can change their phenotype in response to changing environments \[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR8)\]. Understanding the epigenetic mechanisms that are at the core of the interplay between the environment and phenotypic plasticity is pivotal for understanding how species respond to or cope with environmental change.

One prevalent example of phenotypic plasticity is sex reversal, by which an animal is capable of changing its phenotypic sex without the need for a corroborative change in DNA. Sex reversal occurs in many lineages of the animal kingdom, such as in reptiles \[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR10)\], amphibians \[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR11)\], fish \[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR12)\], and a wide variety of invertebrates \[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR13)– [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR17)\]. The plasticity and frequency with which animals can reverse sex are partly determined by the underlying sex determination mechanisms, which can be roughly divided into genetic sex determination (GSD) and environmental sex determination (ESD). The ability to reverse sex can be advantageous in highly dynamic environments, where sex-related differences in fitness may favour transition into one sex under specific environmental conditions \[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR18)– [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR21)\]. During sex reversal, epigenetic mechanisms play a pivotal role in facilitating sex differentiation by influencing gene expression \[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR8), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR22)– [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR24)\].

Oysters represent excellent candidates for studying epigenetic mechanisms underlying sex reversal since they are sequential hermaphrodites that can repeatedly alternate between male and female sex phenotypes \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR15), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR25), [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR26)\]. A variety of environmental factors have been documented to initiate sex reversal in oysters by altering DNA methylation (e.g. acidification \[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR27)\] and starvation \[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR28)\]), in the gonads. Differential DNA methylation between phenotypic sexes, referred to as sex-specific DNA methylation, are suggested to lead to sex differentiation by influencing gene transcription \[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR14), [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR28)– [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR31)\]. Generally, energetically demanding or restricting conditions lead to masculinization of gonadal tissue \[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR28), [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR32)\]. The association between DNA methylation and sex reversal has been primarily studied in gonad tissue, where sex-specific DNA methylation and gene expression are expected to have a direct relation to gametogenesis \[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR33), [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR31)\]. In the Pacific oyster ( _Magallana gigas_), differential methylation and expression of several genes are shown to be involved with sex differentiation in the gonads \[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR29)– [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR31), [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR34)\]. Interestingly, during the process of sex reversal, oysters often display intermediate sex stages where they simultaneously produce male and female reproductive tissue of different developmental stages \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR15)\]. These individuals are characterized as hermaphrodites that display either male or female biased gonad tissue, or represent gonadal tissue containing both sexes with equal ratios \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR15), [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR35)\]. The simultaneous occurrence of male, female, and hermaphrodite individuals within one population is suggested to represent a phenotypically plastic response to temporally dynamic environments \[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR36)\]. Although sequential hermaphroditism is frequently observed in oysters and hermaphrodite individuals contribute largely to reproductive cohorts in wild populations \[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR36)\], previous studies have been exclusively comparing sex-specific DNA methylation between males and females \[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR29), [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR30), [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR37)\]. Hence, sex-specific DNA methylation of hermaphrodite individuals remains poorly understood \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR15), [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR30), [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR36)– [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR38)\]. However, understanding how DNA methylation may differ between male, female, and hermaphrodite individuals is crucial for understanding the role of DNA methylation during different stages of sex reversal in oysters \[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR38)\].

Currently, sex reversal in oysters is understudied, since existing methods of sex-identification require sampling of gonad tissue and are therefore lethal. Notably, sex-specific DNA methylation is not restricted to gonadal tissue and accommodates sex-associated differences in somatic tissues (e.g. mantle and abductor muscle) and even whole-body methylomes of different invertebrates \[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR14), [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR39), [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR40)\]. This highlights the relevance of characterizing differential DNA methylation in somatic tissues between different sex phenotypes in oysters \[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR14)\]. Gill tissue, along with other somatic tissues, is often collected during biosecurity or monitoring surveys where the tissue can be sampled non-lethally, by using anaesthetics \[ [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR41), [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR42)\]. As such, identifying sex-specific methylation in somatic tissue would pave the way for non-lethal alternatives of sex-identification.

Like many other bivalves, the European flat oyster ( _Ostrea edulis;_ Linnaeus, 1758) is a sequential hermaphrodite that can reverse sex within one reproductive season \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR15), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR25)\]. It plays a critical role in the ecosystem by sustaining biodiversity through generating biogenic reef habitats \[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR43)– [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR45)\]. The species is currently considered ‘threatened’ according to the Oslo-Paris Convention, due to ongoing habitat degradation, overfishing, and the spread of diseases \[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR46)– [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR49)\]. Recently, its decline in population stocks initiated restoration efforts to restock degraded populations with hatchery-produced oysters \[ [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR44), [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR50), [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR51)\]. However, male-biased skewed sex ratios limit reproductive output and are thought to hamper the upscaling of oyster culturing used for kick-starting oyster reef restoration \[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR35), [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR52)\]. Identifying epigenetic mechanisms that underly sex reversal is crucial for a better understanding of the reproductive strategy of _O. edulis_ and can facilitate in improving culturing strategies of the species \[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR32), [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR38)\].

Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether sex-specific DNA methylation is present in somatic gill tissue, and to characterize the regional differences in sex-specific DNA methylation between male, female, and hermaphrodite flat oysters ( _O. edulis_). By comparing gill methylomes using nanopore sequencing we show the presence of regional sex-specific DNA methylation across the genome. This study is the first to include DNA methylation of hermaphrodite individuals, providing new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying sex reversal in a sequential hermaphrodite invertebrate. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of using somatic tissues to study sex reversal for non-lethal applications.

## Results

Whole genome DNA methylomes obtained from gill tissue of flat oysters were compared between male, female, and hermaphrodite sex stages, with the aim of characterizing sex-specific DNA methylation. Oyster sex was identified using histology and five sex stages were distinguished: male (M), female (F), hermaphrodite predominantly male (HPM), hermaphrodite predominantly female (HPF), and hermaphrodite both sexes equally present (HBS). In total, whole-genome sequencing of 35 flat oyster individuals resulted in 111 million reads, with an average of 3.2 million reads per individual (Supplementary Table S1). Sequencing of all oysters was performed on 8 different 10.4 PromethION flow cells. Mapping of reads with minimal quality of 60 to the _O. edulis_ reference genome (XbOstEdul1.1), resulted in an average of 12.2 Gb per individual with read lengths varying between 1.1 −14.6 Kb and an average mapping percentage of 86.9% (Supplemental Table S1; submitted to ENA under accession number PRJEB85091). No significant difference in number of sequenced base pairs was observed between the five sex phenotypes (one-way ANOVA, F statistic = 0.872, _p_-value = 0.49; Supplementary Fig S1A). After CpG calling using _modkit_, between 10.4 and 30.5 million CpGs per individual, with a minimum coverage of 3, were used for downstream analysis.

### General methylation patterns

Analysis of differentially methylated loci (DML) resulted in 555,259 CpG loci that were differentially methylated between any of the five sex phenotypes, with minimal coverage of 3 for all individuals. These CpGs were used as input for PCA analysis representing all sites that were differentially methylated between any two of the five sex phenotypes (Fig. [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig1) A). PC1 (13.1% variance explained) shows clear separation between the five sex phenotypes with a gradient from male and female, to the three hermaphrodite sex phenotypes (HPM, HPF, and HBS).

Comparative analysis of differentially methylated loci (DMLs) between five sex phenotypes of flat oysters (M, F, HPM, HPF, and HBS). **A** Principal component analysis of all differentially methylated CpGs between any two of the five sex phenotypes (555,259 sites). **B** Distribution over genomic location of CpGs (minimal coverage of 3), DMLs identified from comparisons between any two of the five sex phenotypes, and DMLs from pairwise comparisons between the five sex phenotypes

### Differentially methylated loci and regions between sex phenotypes

Characterization of DMLs between all five sex stages resulted in a total of 1506 loci in which minimally two sex phenotypes showed significant differential methylation (BH corrected q-value < 0.01, ≥ 20% methylation difference; Supplementary Table S2). The pairwise comparison between HPM and HBS resulted in the highest number of DMLs (27,363 DMLs; 13,366 hypermethylated in HBS, and 13,997 hypermethylated in HPM; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Between M-HPF 4136 DMLs were identified, representing the lowest number of DMLs from all pairwise comparisons, followed by 4252 DMLs between F-HPF (Supplementary Fig. S2A).

The majority of DMLs were located in introns (56.6%), followed by intergenic regions (20.4%), exons (16.0%), and promoters (7.0%; Fig. [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig1) B). The genomic distribution of significant DMLs from pairwise comparisons between sex phenotypes differed significantly from the genomic distribution of all CpGs (minimal coverage of 3 for all individuals; Pearson’s correlation: _p_-value < 0.05; Supplementary Table S3). Here, significant DMLs found between pairwise comparisons showed a positive association with intronic regions, and a negative association with intergenic regions.

Characterization of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using a sliding-window approach resulted in a total of 21,160 significant DMRs from pairwise comparisons between any two of the five sex phenotypes (BH corrected q < 0.01, ≥ 20% methylation difference; Supplementary Table S4). Merging DMRs that were within 100 bp proximity of each other obtained a total of 9,651 DMRs that varied in length of 201 to 4001 base pairs (Supplementary Table S4). Generally, hermaphrodite sex phenotypes HPM and HBS showed higher numbers of DMRs than pairwise comparisons with or among males, females, or HPF. The highest number of DMRs was found between HPM and HBS (3369 DMRs, 1829 hypermethylated in HPM, and 1540 hypermethylated in HBS; Supplementary Fig. S2B). The lowest number of DMRs weas observed between females and HPF (164 DMRs; 84 hypermethylated in females, and 80 hypermethylated in HPF). Methylome comparison between males and females resulted in a total of 239 DMRs (125 hypermethylated in males, 114 hypermethylated in females). Two examples of DMRs between sex phenotypes have been visualized (Fig. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig2) A,B).

### Gene annotation of differential methylation

Identifying differentially methylated genes (DMGs), genes overlapping with DMRs, resulted in a total of 2,576 unique DMGs between pairwise comparisons of all five sex phenotypes (Fig. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig2) C). Of all these genes, 828 unique DMGs were identified between HPM and HBS. Males, HPM, and HBS showed to have the highest overlap in DMGs (Fig. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig2)). Clustering analysis also revealed highest similarity in DMGs between M-HBS, and HPM-HBS. Additionally, F-HPM, M-HPM, and HPM-HPF also showed high similarity in identified DMGs, but clustered as a separate group with unique DMGs (Fig. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig2) D). The DMGs with highest difference in average methylation percentage between pairwise comparisons were: _MAM and LDL-receptor class A domain-containing protein 2-like_ (LOC125683627; HPM-HBS), _UDP-GalNAc:beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2-like_ (LOC125659768; F-HPM and F-HPM), _ATP-dependent DNA helicase Q5-like_ (LOC125679612; M-HBS), and _sacsin-like_ (LOC125679280; HPM-HBS; Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Tab1)). A complete overview of the top 10 most hypermethylated and hypomethylated DMGs identified for all pairwise comparisons can be found in the supplementary material (Supplementary Table S5).

In total, 125 genes were found to be differentially methylated between male and female oysters, of which 62 DMGs were hypermethylated in males, and 63 DMGs were hypermethylated in females (Supplementary Table S6). When compared to DMGs identified between other sex phenotypes, 15 DMGs were uniquely differentially methylated between males and females (Supplementary Table S6). DMGs with highest difference in methylation percentage between males and females were: _tRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase non-catalytic subunit wdr4-like (_ LOC125645763), uncharacterized LOC125655458, uncharacterized LOC125673983, where males were hypermethylated compared to females. DMGs with highest difference in average methylation percentage and females showing hypermethylation compared to males were: uncharacterized LOC125661226, uncharacterized LOC125661253, and _periodic tryptophan protein 1 homolog_ (LOC125674140). Other DMGs uniquely identified between male and female oysters were: _cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor ATF-2-like_ (LOC125646345), _inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha-like_ (LOC125668035), _neuronal calcium sensor 2-like_ (LOC125669759), _PR domain zinc finger protein 4-like_ (LOC125680421) _,_ and _zinc finger protein 474-like_ (LOC130054705).

### Functional enrichment analyses

Analysis of difference in average methylation percentage over all DMRs within a DMGs resulted in 21 DMGs with a difference in average methylation percentage > 45%. DMGs with highest difference in average methylation percentage were _proton-coupled zinc antiporter SLC30 A2-like_ (LOC125645560; HPM-HBS), _MAM and LDL-receptor class A domain-containing protein 2-like_ (LOC125683627; HPM-HBS), LOC125655710 (F-HPM), _and probable nuclear hormone receptor HR3_ (LOC125661857; M-HPM & F-HPM), _ATP-dependent DNA helicase Q5-like_ (LOC125679612; Me-HBS), and _protein ILRUN-like_ (LOC125645979; M-HBS; Fig. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig3) B). Differential methylation between HPM-HBS was observed in the _lysosome membrane protein 2-like gene_ (LOC125645858), belonging to the superfamily of ABC transporters \[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR53)\].

BP were clustered hierarchically with Pearson’s correlation coefficient. **B** Heatmap of DMGs with an average difference in methylation percentage > 45%. Positive differences in average methylation percentage indicate hypomethylation for the first group per pairwise comparison, negative differences in average methylation percentage indicate hypermethylation for the first group per pairwise comparison. **C** Scatter plot of enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways for DMGs identified between the five sex phenotypes

Functional enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms of annotated DMGs resulted in 128 significant enriched GO terms for Biological Processes (BP; Fig. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig3) A), 45 enriched GO terms for Cellular Components (CC; Supplementary Figure S4), and 64 enriched GO terms for Molecular Function (MF; Supplementary Figure S5). GO terms for Biological Processes were related to neuronal activity and locomotion (e.g. GO0061564: axon development, GO0048666: neuron development, GO0040011: locomotion, and GO0006935: chemotaxis), protein targeting and localization (e.g. GO0006605: protein targeting and GO0015031: protein transport) and cellular and metabolic processes (e.g. GO0030030: cell projection organization, GO0051641: cellular localization, GO0009117: nucleotide metabolic process, and GOGO0006793: phosphorus metabolic process). Processes related to stress response were enriched in DMGs found between males and HBS (GO0043087: regulation of GTPase activity, GO0033554: cellular response to stress, and GO0042221: response to chemical”).Additionally, DMGs found between males and HPF were enriched in the “semaphorin-plexin signalling pathway” (GO0071526, GO1902285, GO1902287). Lastly, unique GO terms found between HPM-HPF were related to meiotic recombination (GO0140527, GO0007131, and GO0035825).

Regarding CC, the largest group of DMGs showed enrichment for “intracellular anatomical structure” (GO0005622) and “organelle” (GO0043226; Supplementary Figure S3. DMGs enriched in MF were mostly related to pathways associated with nucleotide binding (e.g. GO0005488: binding, GO0005524: ATP binding, GO0030554: adenyl nucleotide binding, and GO0032559: adenyl ribonucleotide binding”; Supplementary Figure S4). Here, DMGs identified between HPM and HBS contributed mostly to these enriched pathways.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of DMGs revealed 25 enriched pathways, of which 2 significant ( _p_ _adjust_ < 0.05; Fig. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig3) C). The most significantly enriched pathways were involved in “Cytoskeleton in muscle cells” and “purine metabolism”. Enriched pathways were mostly related to energy homeostasis due to their association with lipid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. “Purine metabolism”, “Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism”, “Beta-Alanine metabolism”, “Inositol phosphate metabolism”, and “Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism”). In addition to metabolism related pathways, DMGs from pairwise comparisons also showed enrichment for processes related to innate immunity (e.g. “ABC transporter” and “Peroxisome”; Fig. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#Fig3) C).

## Discussion

In invertebrates, DNA methylation is thought to contribute to phenotypic plasticity by increasing transcriptional variation in various ways (e.g. alternative splicing, increasing mutation rate) \[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR8)\]. The mosaic gene-body methylation is suggested to create transcriptional opportunities rather than activate or inhibit transcription through (de)methylation in the promoter region \[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR8)\]. Sex reversal, a phenotypically plastic trait whereby animals can reverse sex in response to environmental change, is associated with DNA methylation where differences between sexes are thought to facilitate this reversal \[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR11), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR22), [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR29), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR54)– [57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR57)\]. Sex-specific DNA methylation has been widely reported in both vertebrates and invertebrates \[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR22), [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR58)– [62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR62)\]. In oysters, differential DNA methylation between male and female individuals is suggested to be associated with sex differentiation in the gonads, where epigenetic differences are linked to differential expression of genes involved in the sex determination pathway \[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR28)– [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR30)\]. Although oysters are sequential hermaphrodites, knowledge on DNA methylation profiles of hermaphrodite individuals, undergoing a sex change, is limited. In this study, we aimed to characterize sex-specific DNA methylation of male, female and hermaphrodite European flat oysters ( _Ostrea edulis),_ by comparing gill methylomes obtained through nanopore sequencing. In general, differential methylation occurred more frequently in intragenic regions (promoters, introns, and exons) than in intergenic regions. These findings are consistent with results from other oyster species, where differential methylation is enriched in intergenic regions \[ [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR63)– [65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR65)\]. The most distinct DNA methylation profile was observed in hermaphrodite oysters, whereas males and females demonstrated more similar patterns of DNA methylation in their gills. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were significantly enriched in pathways related to energy homeostasis and metabolism. Collectively, our data suggests that sequential hermaphrodites display an alternative state that represents the epigenetic reprogramming required for sex reversal. Additionally, the observed presence of sex-specific DNA methylation in gill tissue highlights the potential for non-lethal sex identification using somatic tissues.

### Hermaphrodite individuals display an alternative epigenetic state in the gills

When oysters undergo sex reversal, gametogenesis of both sexes can occur within the same follicle \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR15)\]. In these hermaphrodites, discrepancies in gamete development most often lead to asynchronous spawning of male and female gametes \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR15)\]. In the gonads, the reversal of sex is accompanied by epigenetic reprogramming that facilitates cell growth, development, regulation, and restructuring, especially during early gametogenesis \[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR30), [66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR66)\]. In this study, whole-genome gill methylome comparisons between sex phenotypes demonstrated that hermaphrodites display the most distinct DNA methylation patterns when compared to males or females. Significantly enriched GO terms overlapping DMGs found between hermaphrodites and other sex phenotypes were related to neuronal activity and locomotion, and cell morphogenesis pathways. Additionally, the KEGG pathway related to “Cytoskeleton in muscle cells” was significantly enriched between hermaphrodite oysters. These findings suggest that hermaphrodite individuals undergoing sex reversal display an alternative state of epigenetic reprogramming when compared to males or females. It is possible that males and females, that have undergone the full process of sex reversal, represent an epigenetic state that matches the completion of sex reversal. Similarly, in a study of Sun et al. (2024), genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of gonadal tissue of _Magallana gigas_ were accurately remodeled to the opposite sex after the completion of sex reversal \[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR30)\].

In addition to the differential methylation patterns observed between male, female, and hermaphrodite individuals, numerous unique GO terms were identified between the different hermaphrodite sex phenotypes (HPM, HPF, and HBS). The majority of differentially methylated loci and regions (DMLs and DMRs) were identified between HPM and HBS. DMGs overlapping those regions showed significant enrichment for processes related to “cellular localization”, “intracellular signal transduction”, “phosphorylation” and “phosphate metabolism”. The differences in annotated GO terms identified across hermaphrodite sex phenotypes imply that the direction of sex reversal is also associated with differential DNA methylation. In _M. gigas_, a genome-wide increase in DNA methylation was observed when oysters reversed sex from female to male \[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR30)\]. While further elucidation of epigenetic reprogramming in hermaphrodite phenotypes is necessary to validate this, the highest number of DMLs and DMRs found between HPM-HBS suggests that the direction of sex reversal is associated with different epigenetic states. This supports the hypothesis that although sex reversal is bidirectional, patterns of epigenetic reprogramming may be different depending on the direction of a sex reversal event.

### Sex-specific DNA methylation of gill tissue is related to energy homeostasis and metabolism

In this study, functional enrichment analysis of DMGs resulted in highest significant enrichment for GO-terms related to metabolic or energy homeostasis processes (e.g. ATP binding, nucleotide binding, hydrolase activity, DNA damage sensor activity). Similar to our findings, differential methylation and expression between prespawning and postspawning oysters was enriched for metabolism and energy homeostasis pathways in gill tissue of _M. gigas_ \[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR67)\]. KEGG enrichment analysis of DMGs resulted in enriched pathways related to lipid, amino-acid, and carbohydrate metabolisms (e.g. “purine metabolism”, “ascorbate and aldarate metabolism”, “beta-Alanine metabolism”, “nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism”). The purine metabolism plays an essential role in energy supply, where it is involved in synthesis, degradation, and recycling of nucleic acids \[ [68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR68)\]. In the mussel _Mytilus coruscus,_ a reduction in energy consumption in the gills was observed after starvation exposure, where proteins related to purine metabolism and nicotinic and nicotinamide metabolism pathways were downregulated \[ [68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR68)\] _._ Additionally, the inositol phosphate metabolism pathway, enriched in DMGs identified between M-HSB and HPM-HBS, contributes to metabolic signaling, and cellular reprogramming and growth in oysters \[ [69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR69), [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR70)\]. Similarly, GO terms related to innate immunity, cell proliferation, and metabolic and developmental processes were enriched in transitionary transcripts of sex reversing wrasses \[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR23)\]. Gametogenesis requires excessive amounts of energy due to enhanced cell growth, cellular restructuring, and reprogramming \[ [71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR71), [72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR72)\]. Therefore, it is likely that oysters undergoing sex reversal require a remodeling of the energy balance in all their tissues, reflecting processes of cell restructuring and rebuilding. The sex-specific differences in genes related to energy homeostasis and metabolism observed in this study, could be explained by a remodeling of the energy balance due to changes in energy requirement as a consequence of sex reversal.

### Changes in immunity and stress response as a consequence of sex-specific DNA methylation

In addition to changes in DNA methylation of genes related to energy homeostasis and metabolism, DMGs found between the different sex phenotypes were also enriched in pathways related to immunity, stress, and toxin response. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a key role in the defensive mechanism against pathogens in bivalves \[ [73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR73), [74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR74)\]. Furthermore, peroxisomes are crucial in toxin response mechanisms \[ [75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR75)\]. Lysosome membrane proteins are involved in the cellular defensive response and vital for the production of phagolysosomes \[ [76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR76)\]. Phagocytosis can have multiple functions in bivalves, namely enhanced innate immune response, or energy recycling by the reabsorption of damaged cells, which can be initiated by sex reversal \[ [77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR77)\]. Upregulation of the phagocytosis pathway was observed in gill proteomes after starvation exposure in the mussel _M. coruscus_\[ [68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR68)\]. One probable explanation of the observed differences in DNA methylation is that oysters of different sex phenotypes adopt different metabolic and immune response strategies depending on their energy requirements for reproduction. Notably, gametogenesis can lead to enhanced susceptibility to pathogens due to increased energetic demands required for reproduction \[ [78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR78)\]. During gametogenesis, reduced phagocytosis activity of hemocytes has also been reported in oysters \[ [79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR79)\]. Similarly, immunity and stress response pathways were found to be enriched in differentially expressed genes identified between pre- and postspawning oysters \[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR67)\]. Postspawning oysters are reported to experience a decrease in global immunity defense and become more vulnerable to chemical stress, due to energy loss after spawning \[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR67), [80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR80)\]. However, this study only assessed the differences in sex-specific DNA methylation, therefore, statements on how sex-specific DNA methylation in gill tissue affects functionality of these genes remains speculative and should be interpreted with caution.

### Somatic sexual dimorphism as a consequence of DNA methylation differences between male and female oysters

Although comparison of DNA methylation between male and female oysters yielded the lowest number of DMRs and DMGs, 125 DMGs could still be identified of which 15 were uniquely differentially methylated between males and females. Most of these unique DMGs were related to metabolic, signaling, or expression related processes. Guanine-N7-methyltransferases are involved in modifications of mRNA caps and required for mRNA processing and functioning \[ [81](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR81)\]. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activity is involved in regulating glycogen breakdown, and suggested to be related to the control of gonad maturation \[ [82](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR82)\]. Another unique DMG found between male and female oysters was _inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (_ IKK _) subunit alpha-like._ IKKs play a central role in cell signalling and are involved with innate immunity in oysters \[ [83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR83)\]. Besides the unique DMGs identified between males and females, other DMGs with high difference in methylation percentage between male and female oysters are associated with pathways that regulate somatic sexual dimorphism in other animals. For example, the serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein (SRRM) was observed to be expressed in the gonads and has been allocated as a candidate sex-identification marker in a shrimp species \[ [84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR84)\]. In _Drosophila melanogaster,_ SRRM1 is involved in genitalia development and somatic sex determination \[ [85](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR85), [86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR86)\]. Additionally, _Transport and Golgi organization protein 6 homolog_ (TANGO6) is associated with mating behaviour in seahorses, where differential expression in somatic brain tissue was observed during mating \[ [87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR87)\]. In zebrafish, sex-specific DNA methylation was observed in genes associated with the arsenic metabolism, which was suggested to lead to sex-specific behavioural changes \[ [88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR88)\]. Likewise, the arsenic metabolism appears to be gender-specific in rats \[ [89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR89)\]. Another interesting gene that was differentially methylated between males and females was prostaglandin E synthase 3-like. Prostaglandins are involved with ovary development and steroidogenesis in other bivalves \[ [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR90)\]. DMGs related to the semaphorin-plexin signaling pathway were solely enriched between M and HPF. Semaphorin proteins are involved in immune system regulation and are crucial for nervous system development \[ [91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR91)\]. Additionally, semaphorin proteins were discovered to be involved in the development of neurons that secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormones in vertebrates, which are essential for reproductive development \[ [91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR91)\]. The ECM-receptor interaction pathway was solely enriched between F-HPF. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions were shown to be enriched in skin transcriptomes of female fish compared to males upon exposure to sex steroids \[ [92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR92)\]. Lastly, _MAM and LDL-receptor class A domain-containing protein 2-like_ are involved in ovarian development in clams \[ [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR90)\]. These examples indicate that even though sex reversal mostly impacts gonadal tissue, somatic tissues are not left unchanged and sex reversal can induce sex-specific processes of cell restructuring or reprogramming in somatic tissues accordingly. Sexual dimorphism is not as profound in oysters as in some other animals, however, indicators of sexual dimorphism are present (e.g. differences in growth or innate immunity \[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR67)\]). Based on the findings of this study, we hypothesize that differential DNA methylation between male and female oysters is associated with sexual dimorphism in somatic tissues as a consequence of sex reversal. However, understanding the link between sex-specific DNA methylation and sexual dimorphism requires further elucidation of the effects of sex-specific DNA methylation on gene functioning.

### Tissue specificity of sex-specific DNA methylation in oyster gills

The occurrence of sex-specific DNA methylation has been reported in various animals and tissue types \[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR14), [61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR61), [93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR93)– [95](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR95)\]. However, literature is inconsistent on the existence of tissue specificity for sex-specific DNA methylation as some studies clearly show altered sex-specific DNA methylation in different tissue types \[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR14), [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR29)\], whereas other studies demonstrate consistent sex-specific whole-body methylomes \[ [93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR93), [96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR96)\]. In a study of Teng et al. (2025), similar DMGs were identified in somatic muscle and gonadal tissue between male and female oysters. The diacylglycerol kinase delta ( _Dgkd_) gene was consistently hypomethylated in somatic muscle and gonadal tissue of female oysters. Additionally, genes involved in Rho protein signal transduction were found to be consistently differentially methylated in both muscle and gonadal tissue \[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR40)\]. In oyster gonads, multiple genes (e.g. _Foxl2_, _Dmrt1_, _Dgkd_), were discovered to be involved in sex differentiation, whereas these genes where not found to be differentially methylated in gill tissue in this study \[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR28)– [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR31), [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR40)\]. Additionally, DNA methylation in gonad tissue was often found to be hypermethylated among males compared to females \[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR29), [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR30), [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR40)\]. In our study, males or females did not show consistent hyper or hypomethylation for DMRs and DMGs. Although the enrichment for GO terms related to metabolism and energy homeostasis pathways do not overlap with DNA methylation patterns found for gonad tissue in other oysters, and may therefore be indicative of functional differences between tissues, a direct comparison of DNA methylation patterns between gill and gonadal tissue was not performed in this study and requires further elucidation.

In _Crassostrea virginica,_ differences in sex-specific gene expression were identified between mantle and gonad transcriptomes \[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR14)\]. Here, differentially expressed genes found between male and female mantle tissue were associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, and lipid transportation. Based on their findings, the authors suggest that sex-specific gene expression in mantle tissue has a specific function that could be potentially related to environmental sensing or signalling in _C. virginica_ \[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR14)\]. The observed enrichment in energy homeostasis and metabolism related pathways in sex-specific DMGs identified in this study could be indicative of functional processes related to sex reversal in the gills. However, to further elucidate potential functional differences in sex-specific DNA methylation of different tissues, more elaborate methylome comparisons between various tissues are required. Additionally, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis are both largely dependent on available gene annotations, and so our discussion on the occurrence of functional sex-specific DNA methylation in the gills is limited to currently available reference genomes and gene annotations.

### Causality dilemma of the role of somatic DNA methylation in sex reversal

Our findings clearly show the presence of sex-specific DNA methylation in gill tissue of _O. edulis_, however, it remains unknown where in the process of sex reversal this gill tissue DNA methylation plays a role. Sex steroids are known to not only influence sex differentiation in reproductive tissues, but can also affect cell fates in somatic tissues all throughout the body \[ [92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR92)\]. The concept of altered whole-body methylomes or transcriptomes in response to treatment with endocrine disrupting chemicals is widely observed in fish \[ [97](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR97)– [99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR99)\]. Interestingly, DNA methylation can also affect sex differentiation vice versa \[ [100](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR100)\]. Based on this, it could be hypothesized that sex-specific DNA methylation of the gills occurs prior to gonadal sex differentiation, and plays a more active part in sex reversal. Environmental stressors like starvation have been demonstrated to affect energy homeostasis and metabolism pathways in the gills of bivalves through influencing gene expression \[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR28), [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR67)\]. Hence, it could be inferred that environmental stressors induce changes in gill DNA methylation, where a remodeling of the energy balance could subsequently induce sex differentiation in the gonads. In this case, gill DNA methylation would represent a more active player in sex reversal. Although gill and gonadal samples were collected simultaneously in this study, we do not know whether the phenotypic sex represented by the gonads is similarly represented by the DNA methylation state of the gills. Furthermore, to better understand differences in sex-specific DNA methylation between different tissues, the effect of sex-specific DNA methylation on gene expression and corresponding functionality should be elucidated.

### Non-lethal sex identification using epigenetic markers

Sex identification is extremely relevant for understanding the process and dynamics of sex reversal in sequential hermaphrodites. Currently, sex identification in oysters is complicated by the dependency on gonadal tissue, of which sampling is lethal. With the use of anesthetics, some somatic tissues can be sampled non-lethally (e.g. abductor muscle, gill, and mantle tissue). Therefore, the use of molecular markers, that rely on somatic tissues for sex identification, provide a promising non-lethal alternative. Epigenetic markers are currently applied to assess sex and age, or response to pollutants in various marine species \[ [101](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR101)– [103](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR103)\]. In our study, comparison of gill methylomes between male and female oysters resulted in the characterization of 125 DMGs. Differential methylation on these genes could provide the basis for generating epigenetic markers that can assess the current sex phenotype of an oyster. Additionally, the distinct DNA methylation profile of hermaphrodite oysters would allow for a higher resolution of sex identification, whereby hermaphrodites could be distinguished from male or female individuals. Collectively, our findings indicate the potential of using somatic gill tissue for non-lethal sex identification utilizing epigenetic markers that can predict the current sex phenotype of an oyster.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this study is the first to characterize sex-specific DNA methylation in somatic gill tissue of a sequential hermaphrodite invertebrate. Our findings suggest that hermaphrodite oysters display distinct differences in gill DNA methylation patterns compared to male and female individuals. Annotation of differentially methylated genes resulted in significant enrichment of pathways associated with energy homeostasis, metabolism, and innate immunity. Collectively, our data suggests that sequential hermaphrodites display an alternative state that represents the epigenetic reprogramming required for sex reversal in a somatic tissue. Additionally, the characterized differentially methylated loci and regions between sex phenotypes from somatic gill tissue provide a basis for non-lethal alternatives to sex identification with epigenetic markers. Taken together, this study contributes to the understanding of epigenetic mechanisms underlying sex reversal in different sex phenotypes of the flat oyster, and shows the relevance of studying sex-specific DNA methylation in somatic tissues in relation to sex reversal.

## Materials and methods

### Sampling site and collection

In this study, DNA methylomes were obtained from whole-genome sequencing of gill tissue of 35 European flat oysters ( _Ostrea edulis_) of different sex phenotypes. Oysters were collected by dredging in April and September 2023, and April 2024 in Grevelingenmeer, the Netherlands (53°30′40″N, 08°06′20″ E). Individuals of similar shell length (74.1 ± 7.45 mm; Supplementary FiS1B) were selected and gill tissue was collected and preserved with RNAlater or snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen. All gill tissue samples were stored at −80 °C until further use. Oysters were collected in the context of the national monitoring for mollusc diseases in the Netherlands. Samples from gill, mantle, and digestive diverticulum tissue were tested for the presence of the haplosporidian _Bonamia ostreae,_ using species-specific real time PCR as described in Kamermans et al. (2023). Two oysters (nr. 3 and 17) tested positive for an infection of _B. ostreae._ We did not correct for this in our analysis, as other physiological differences between individuals were not assessed nor included in this analysis.

### Histological sex identification

Cross sections of tissue representing both reproductive, respiratory, and digestive organs were embedded in paraffin. Sections (± 5 µm) were stained with haematoxylin–eosin for histological observation. Each oyster was categorized a sex stage and gonad development index, according to the study of da Silva et al. (2009) \[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR15)\]. The five sex stages are as follows: _male_ (M), _female_ (F), _hermaphrodite predominantly male_ (HPM), _hermaphrodite predominantly female_ (HPF), or _hermaphrodite both sexes equally present_ (HBS). The gonad development index was considered as follows: _Inactive or resting gonad_ (0), _early gametogenesis_ (1), _advanced gametogenesis_ (2), _mature_ (3), _partially spawned gonad_ (4), _reabsorbing gonad_ (5). Oysters that displayed no clear gonad tissue and were therefore categorized to be in the inactive or resting gonad phase (0) were not used for analysis. In total, 35 oysters were used for DNA methylome sequencing; 9 M, 8 F, 5 HPM, 9 HPF, and 4 HBS oysters. An overview of all histological images can be found in the supplementary material (Supplementary Figure S5).

### DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from oyster gill tissue using the Qiagen Gentra Kit for genomic DNA or Monarch HMW DNA extraction kit for tissue, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen catalog no. 158667; NEB catalog no. T3060). Sample input varied from 20 to 30 mg of frozen gill tissue and was grinded using liquid nitrogen. Long DNA (> 20 Kb) was sheared using g-TUBES (Covaris, USA) in 1 min centrifugation steps of 8, 10, 12, 14 (x1000G) respectively. Short reads were eliminated using the SRE XS PacBio kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). DNA was quantified using the HS Qubit assay (Life Technologies, ThermoFisher Scientific). Quality and length of DNA was visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis.

### Library preparation & sequencing

To prepare samples for whole-genome sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore Platform (ONT, Oxford, UK), short-read eliminated samples were used for end-prep and DNA repair, followed by barcode and adapter ligation according to the native barcoding protocol (SQK-NBD114-24). Up to a maximum of five oysters were simultaneously sequenced using PromethtION R10.4.1 flowcells (FLO-PRO114M) on a PromethION-24 device, using MinKNOW software versions: 23.04.5 (July 2023), 23.07.12 (December 2023), 24.02.19 (May 2024), and 24.06.15 (December 2024). A minimum read quality threshold of 7 was applied.

### Bioinformatics

#### Raw read processing

Raw sequenced reads (POD5) were basecalled using Dorado v0.4.1 \[ [104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR104)\], allowing for simultaneous super accuracy basecalling (SUP) of canonical basepairs using model dna\_r10.4.1\_e8.2\_400bps\_sup@4.2.0, and 5 mC modifications using the _–modified-bases 5 mC_ flag for the detection of modified bases. The reads were mapped to the reference genome xbOstEdul1.1 (NCBI RefSeq Assembly: GCF\_947568905.1 \[ [105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR105)\]) with minimap2 \[ [106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR106)\] as a built-in tool within the Dorado _basecaller_ function. After mapping, the reads were demultiplexed using the _demux_ function of Dorado. Mapped BAM files were then filtered on a minimal mapping quality of 60 and all unmapped reads or secondary alignments were removed using _Samtools_ v1.17 \[ [107](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR107)\]. After filtering, BAM files were sorted and indexed using _Samtools._ Descriptive statistics for BAM files were generated using NanoPack2 v1.12.0 \[ [108](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR108)\].

#### CpG calling

The _pileup_ function of Modkit v0.2.1 ( [https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit)) was used to call CpGs from the mapped BAM files to generate BEDmethyl output files, using the xbOstEdul1.1 reference genome \[ [105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR105)\]. For some CpG sites more than half of the reads were identified as Ndel, indicating the read contains a deletion on this site compared to the reference genome. Reads where the number of Ndels was ≥ 60% of the total coverage for the corresponding CpG site were removed from the dataset.

### Differential methylation analysis

#### Characterization of differentially methylated loci and regions

BEDmethyl files generated by Modkit were used as input for methylKit v.0.99.2 in R v.4.3.3 \[ [109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR109), [110](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR110)\]. Methylation percentages were calculated for every CpG site by dividing the sum of methylated CpGs by the total number of CpGs covered. Methylation calls were filtered to a minimum required coverage of 3 reads per CpG site for all individuals. Methylation call distributions between samples were normalized using the _normalizeCoverage_ function to reduce the potential bias in varying coverage among individuals. For pairwise comparisons between sex phenotypes, data was reorganized to include only the individuals pertaining the selected sex phenotypes, using the _reorganize_ function. CpG sites of individuals from two sex phenotypes were then merged using the _unite_ function. To correct for a potential effect of maturation development stage on DNA methylation, maturation stage was added as a covariate.

Using a logistic regression, differentially methylated loci (DMLs) were identified for each pairwise comparison, using the _calculateDiffMeth_ function in methylKit. _P_-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamin-Hochberg correction. DMLs were defined as loci with a minimal methylation difference of 20% between the two compared sex phenotypes, and a q-value < 0.01 (BH corrected). For every pairwise comparison, the number of hypermethylated and hypomethylated DMLs were determined whereby a hypermethylated DML was defined as a CpG site where the treatment group was more methylated than the control group. A hypomethylated DML was defined as a CpG locus where the treatment group was less methylated than the control group.

Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using a sliding-window approach of 200 bp window slides and 100 bp intervals, using the _tileMethylCounts_ function from methylKit, with maturation stage added as a covariate. Only windows containing ≥ 5 CG loci ( _cov.bases_), a minimal difference in methylation percentage of 20%, and BH-adjusted q-value < 0.01 were considered as DMRs. Hypermethylated DMRs were defined as DMRs where the treatment group was hypermethylated compared to the control group. Hypomethylated DMRs were defined as DMRs where the treatment group was hypomethylated compared to the control group. Differentially methylated loci and regions were visualized from BED files using IGV v2.19.1 \[ [111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR111)\].

To identify the distribution of DMRs over genomic features (promoter, exon, intron, intergenic region), the position of genomic features was extracted from the reference genome using _readTranscriptFeatures_ from methylKit. Subsequently DMRs were annotated to these genomic features using _annotateWithGeneParts_ function from the genomation package \[ [112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR112)\]. Promoters were defined as regions 1000 bp upstream or downstream of Transcription Start Sites (TSS). To test if there was an association between genomic location of DMRs and the genomic location of all CpGs with minimal coverage of 3 for all individuals, chi-square contingency pairwise tests were used.

#### Identifying differentially methylated genes

To identify the differentially methylated genes (DMGs), genes overlapping with DMRs, the DMRs within 100 bp proximity of one another were first merged together. Subsequently, gene coordinates were extracted from the reference annotation (GCF\_947568905.1\_xbOstEdul1.1\_genomic.gtf.gz \[ [105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR105)\]) using the _gene_ function of GenomicFeatures \[ [113](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR113)\] _._ Genetic description and GeneID were added using _getGenes_ from mygene \[ [114](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR114)\]. Genes were considered statistically differentially methylated if they contained at least one DMR with minimal methylation percentage of 20% and BH-adjusted q-value < 0.01.

To analyse functional enrichment of annotated DMGs, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using TopGO in Bioconductor \[ [115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR115)\]. Using the Gene Annotation File (GAF) the reference genome (GCF\_947568905.1-RS\_2023\_05\_gene\_ontology.gaf), GO terms were annotated to geneIDs and separated based on GO term categories: Biological Processes (BP), Cellular Components (CC), or Molecular Function (MF). Go terms with _p_ < 0.001 were considered significantly enriched by DMR-overlapping genes. Heatmaps were generated using the pheatmap package in R \[ [116](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR116)\]. The upset plot was generating using UpSetR \[ [117](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR117)\].

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed using the KEGGrest \[ [118](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR118)\] package in R.Enrichment pathways were imported for _Ostrea edulis_ (organism code: “oed”; RefSeq Assembly: GCF\_947568905.1) using _keggLink._ Enrichment analysis was performed using the _enrichKEGG_ function from the clusterProfiler package \[ [119](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR119)\]. A Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment of p-values was applied to correct for False Discovery Rate (FDR).

#### General statistical analysis

To check for differences in average shell length and average sequenced Gb per sex phenotype, one-way ANOVAs were performed using the _stats_ package from R \[ [120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR120)\]. With Shapiro–Wilk’s and Levene’s test, deviations from normality and homogeneity of variance of the residuals were validated using the _car_ package v3.1.3 \[ [121](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144841/#CR121)\].

## Abstract

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have the potential to affect organism acclimatization and adaptation to environmental changes by influencing their phenotypic plasticity; however, little is known about the role of methylation in the adaptive phenotypic divergence of marine invertebrates. Therefore, in this study, a typical intertidal species, the Pacific oyster ( _Crassostrea gigas_), was selected to investigate the epigenetic mechanism of phenotypic plasticity in marine invertebrates. Intertidal and subtidal oysters subjected to one-generation common garden experiments and exhibited phenotypic divergence were used. The methylation landscape of both groups of oysters was investigated under temperate and high temperature. The two tidal oysters exhibited divergent methylation patterns, regardless of the temperature, which was mainly original environment-induced. Intertidal samples exhibited significant hypomethylation and more plasticity of methylation in response to heat shock, while subtidal samples showed hypermethylation and less plasticity. Combined with RNA-seq data, a positive relationship between methylation and expression in gene bodies was detected on a genome-wide scale. In addition, approximately 11% and 7% of differentially expressed genes showed significant methylation variation under high temperatures in intertidal and subtidal samples, respectively. Genes related to apoptosis and organism development may be regulated by methylation in response to high temperature in intertidal oysters, whereas oxidation-reduction and ion homeostasis-related genes were involved in subtidal oysters. The results also suggest that DNA methylation mediates phenotypic divergence in oysters adapting to different environments. This study provides new insight into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity in adaptation to rapid climate change in marine organisms.

## Introduction

Phenotypic plasticity is a key adaptive mechanism for facing the challenges of changing natural conditions and human disturbances, as it allows a given genotype to produce different phenotypes (Holloway [2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR19); Williams et al. [2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR52)). This is thought to be particularly important for species living in highly variable environments, because it serves as a buffer and enables the individual to match its phenotype to a range of stress conditions. The intertidal zone represents one of the most vulnerable and susceptible regions in the sea, as it shows dramatic variation on both spatial and temporal scales in abiotic and biotic conditions. Temperature is one of the major abiotic factors, and fluctuates widely in the intertidal region during daily and seasonal exposure to air (Southward [1958](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR49)). These drastic changes in environmental temperature pose potentially critical challenges for ectothermic marine invertebrates, as changes in their body temperatures can directly modulate their rates of biochemical reactions and biological processes (Pörtner et al. [2007](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR42); Schulte et al. [2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR47); Somero [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR48); Sunday et al. [2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR50)).

One mechanism of phenotypic plasticity that can regulate gene expression and facilitate adaptation is epigenetics, which refers to processes capable of regulating gene activity without altering the underlying DNA sequence (Deans and Maggert [2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR5)). Histone modifications, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNA activity (e.g., miRNA) are the most commonly described epigenetic modifications. Among these, DNA methylation is one of the best-characterized epigenetic mechanisms due to the ease of study and rapidly growing amount of literatures, whose capacity to shape fitness-related phenotypes has attracted the interest of ecologists and evolutionary biologists. The importance of DNA methylation in development differentiation has been highlighted by previous studies in fish, sea turtles, and oysters (Ellison et al. [2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR9); Riviere et al. [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR44); Venegas et al. [2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR51)). Environment-induced variation in DNA methylation has also been investigated in marine invertebrates. For example, environmentally susceptible corals (Putnam et al. [2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR43)), reef-building coral (Liew et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR27)), and invasive colonial ascidians (Hawes et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR18)) can adjust their DNA methylation status to regulate their phenotypic plasticity and thus rapidly adapt to ocean acidification and high temperatures. Changes, such as salinity stress (Zhang et al. [2017a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR57)), air exposure (Zhang et al. [2017b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR58)), and diuron exposure (Rondon et al. [2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR60)), can also induce global DNA methylation variation in oysters. Studies have demonstrated that temperature stress can induce significant global DNA methylation changes in ascidians, Antarctic polychaetes, and the three-spine stickleback (Hawes et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR18); Marsh and Pasqualone [2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR33); Metzger and Schulte [2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR35)). Most of these studies focus on direct environmental effects, but heritable epigenetic modification in offspring generations deserves further investigation, because it could make it possible to predict environmental effects and adaptive potential in the face of environmental change in marine organisms.

Fine-scale differentiation in nearby habitats can be mediated by DNA methylation. For example, individuals of _Laguncularia racemosa_ from salt marsh and riverside exhibited little genetic but abundant methylation differentiation, implying the important role of epigenetic variation in coping with different environments in natural populations (Lira-Medeiros et al. [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR28)). In marine organisms, differentiation of phenotypic traits in thermal tolerance (Diederich and Pechenik [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR6)), flexibility of physiology (Fernandez-Reiriz et al. [2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR11)), and transcriptome profiles (Place et al. [2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR41)) between intertidal and subtidal animals have been reported in previous studies. However, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain unexplored. The sessile oyster, as one of the dominant species in the intertidal and shallow subtidal region, provides an ideal model to study adaptive phenotypic divergence. In our previous study, differentiation has been identified between intertidal and subtidal oysters subjected to one-generation common garden experiments in multiple traits, including growth, survival, physiological, and transcriptomic responses at high temperature (Li et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR25)). We propose that DNA methylation may underlie the adaptive phenotypic plasticity above. In this study, we attempted to further investigate DNA methylation as an epigenetic control mechanism underlying adaptive phenotypic divergence in _Crassostrea_ _gigas_. By performing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) combined with RNA-seq analysis, this study linked epigenetic variation to gene expression. This was intended to enable us not only to explore the epigenetic basis underlying the mechanisms of adaptive phenotypic divergence that may modulate the capacity of organisms to cope with environmental change, but also to investigate the heritable epigenetic effects thereby induced. This study aims to support the understanding of acclimatization, and hence improve culture mode design for aquaculture (Mondol et al. [2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR36)).

## Materials and methods

### Common garden experiments and heat-stress treatment

The breeding and the heat-stress treatment of the oysters used in this study were performed in a previous study (Li et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR25)). Two wild oyster groups collected from the intertidal and subtidal zones at Laoting (39°16′N, Tangshan, Hebei province, China) were translocated to Qingdao for 1 month of acclimatization before spawning. The breeding was carried out under the condition of seawater at 22.5–23.5 °C temperature and 29 ± 0.5‰ salinity. For each group, eggs from 30 mature female oysters were mixed and then divided into 30. Each was fertilized individually with each of the 30 mature male oysters. The zygotes from each male individual were incubated in a 70-L plastic container. At the D-shaped stage, larvae from six containers were combined to form one group with three culture replicates (Fig. [S1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM1)). The rearing of larvae and spat was performed using standard practices (Guo et al. [2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR14)). Spats were put into cages and cultured in the sea at a density of ~100 individuals per layer when the shell height reached 3 cm. Cages were changed four times each year to decrease the density as the size of the oysters increased. All culture replicates were well maintained in the sea. The 10-month-old F1-generation oysters were acclimated in the laboratory aquarium (temperature: 14.2–18.2 °C; salinity: 31.3 ± 0.5‰) for 15 days with aerated, filtered seawater before the experiments. Commercial spirulina powder was added as a food source, and seawater was changed daily.

Oysters of both groups were randomly selected and exposed to acute heat shock (35 °C) for 6 h. Seawater was not changed, and the oysters were not fed during this period. The gills sampled at 0 and 6 h ( _n_ = 15 each sample time in each group) were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C for DNA extraction. InC/SubC and InH/SubH were used to represent control and heat-shock treatment samples from the intertidal/subtidal area.

### Library construction and bisulfite sequencing

Genomic DNA was isolated from gills using a Marine Animals DNA Kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. DNA from 15 individuals in each sampling group was equally mixed to generate three biological replicates of five individuals. A total amount of 5.2 µg of genomic DNA spiked with 26 ng of lambda DNA was fragmented by sonication to 200–300 bp with Covaris S220, followed by end repair and adenylation. Cytosine-methylated barcodes were ligated to sonicated DNA as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Thereafter, these DNA fragments were treated twice with bisulfite using EZ DNA Methylation-GoldTM Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA) before the single-strand DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil + ReadyMix (2X). Library concentration was quantified by Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA) and quantitative PCR, and the insert size was assayed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500/4000 platform, and 125-bp/150-bp paired-end reads were generated. Image analysis and base calling were performed with an Illumina CASAVA pipeline and, finally, 125-bp/150-bp paired-end reads were generated.

### Quality control and mapping

First, FastQC (fastqc\_v0.11.5) (Andrews [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR1)) was used to perform basic statistics relevant to the quality of the raw reads. Thereafter, reads produced by the Illumina pipeline in FASTQ format were preprocessed through Trimmomatic (Trimmomatic-0.36) software (Bolger et al. [2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR4)) using the parameter (SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15; LEADING: 3, TRAILING: 3; ILLUMINACLIP: adapter.fa: 2: 30: 10; MINLEN: 36). The remaining reads that passed all filtering steps were counted as clean reads and used in all subsequent analyses. Finally, FastQC was used to perform basic statistics on the quality of clean data reads.

Bismark software (Felix and Andrews [2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR10)) was used to perform alignments of bisulfite-treated reads to a reference genome (Zhang et al. [2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR56)) using the parameter (–score\_min L, 0, −0.2, -X 700 –dovetail). The reference genome was first transformed into a bisulfite-converted version (C-to-T and G-to-A converted) and then indexed using bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg [2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR24)). Sequence reads were also transformed into fully bisulfite-converted versions (C-to-T and G-to-A converted) before they were aligned to similarly converted versions of the genome in a directional manner. Sequence reads that produced a unique alignment from the two alignment processes (original top and bottom strand) were then compared with the normal genomic sequence, and the methylation state of all cytosine positions in the read was inferred. The same reads that aligned to the same regions of genome were regarded as duplicates. The sequencing depth and coverage were summarized using deduplicated reads. The bisulfite nonconversion rate was calculated as the percentage of cytosine sequenced at cytosine reference positions in the lambda genome.

### Methylation-level calculation and differentially methylated region analysis

To calculate the methylation level (ML) of the sequence, sequences were divided into multiple bins, with a bin size of 10 kb. The sum of methylated and unmethylated read counts in each window was calculated. ML was defined as

|     |
| --- |
| MLC=readsmCreadsmC+readsC. |

Calculated ML was further corrected with the bisulfite nonconversion rate according to previous studies (Lister et al. [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR29)). Given the bisulfite nonconversion rate _r_, the corrected ML was estimated as

|     |
| --- |
| MLcorrected=ML−r1−r. |

Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using DSS software (Hao et al. [2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR16); Hao et al. [2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR17); Park and Wu [2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR39)) with parameters (smoothing.span = 200, delta = 0, p.threshold = 1e−05, minlen = 50, minCG = 3, dis.merge = 100, pct.sig = 0.5). According to the distribution of DMRs through the genome, we defined the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) as genes whose gene body region (from transcription start site to transcription end site) or promoter region (from 2 kb upstream to the transcription start site) had at least 1-bp overlap with the DMRs.

### SNP identification and correlation analysis

SNP calling was conducted using Bis-SNP v.1.0.1 software (Liu et al. [2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR30)) individually ( _n_ = 12) on deduplicated BAM files produced from the Bismark pipeline, with 5.74 million positions generated. High-quality SNP positions were filtered at the coverage of 10–100 in each sample, with 2.32 million positions (40.42%) remaining. Remained SNPs were used to perform pairwise genotypic correlations.

To evaluate the genetic effect on epigenetic difference between the two tidal oysters, we used sample groups of InC and SubC to calculate _F_ ST and conduct correlation analysis with methylation level according to Liew et al.’s method (Liew et al. [2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR26)). A total of 16,516 genes passed the filtration with ≥10 SNPs and ≥5 methylated positions. _F_ ST value in per position was calculated using the equation described in Bhatia et al. (Bhatia et al. [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR3))

|     |
| --- |
| F^=∑k=1MN^\[k\]∑k=1MD^\[k\], |

where _F_ is the averaged _F_ ST value across a particular gene and markers _k_ = 1, 2, …, _M_ denote individual SNPs within this gene. _N_ and _D_ are the numerator and denominator of Hudson’s equation, respectively

|     |
| --- |
| N=p1−p22, |

|     |
| --- |
| D=p11−p2+p21−p1, |

where _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 denote allelic frequencies of the nonreference base among the intertidal and subtidal samples, respectively.

### DAPC analysis

A discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was conducted using methylation level of genes calculated on common C sites among 12 samples in order to remove genetic bias in adegenet R package (Jombart et al. [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR22)). To compare plasticity of DNA methylation in response to heat stress, we used the unstressed oyster (0 h) axis as a measuring scale to quantify the shift in DNA methylation in oysters following heat stress. The magnitude of this shift represents a quantitative measure of genome-wide methylation plasticity. We inferred the size of the shift at heat shock by comparing with that at 0 h (the length of the arrows in Fig. [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig1)) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) linear mixed models. We derived the _P_ value for plasticity difference of intertidal and subtidal samples by analyzing 2800 MCMC samples of parameter estimates.

### Association between DNA methylation and gene expression

We used the RNA-seq data produced by our previous study (Li et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR25)), which are publicly available at the Sequence Read Archive database with the accession number PRJNA407831, and matched it with the WGBS data on identical materials from the present study. To analyze the correlation between DNA methylation and expression level, the mean methylation level and fragments per kilobase million (FPKM) value for each gene was calculated. Scatterplot and Pearson correlation coefficients ( _r_) were performed to display the global correlation between methylation level in gene body and expression. Genes were further grouped together according to expression level to exhibit the corresponding methylation status. Nonexpressed genes (FPKM < 1) and expressed genes were grouped. The latter were then divided into three groups, with the first quartile (FPKM < 25%) having the lowest expression level and the last quartile (FPKM > 75%) having the highest.

### Enrichment analysis of DMR-related genes

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of genes related to DMRs was implemented by the GOseq R package (Young et al. [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR54)), in which gene-length bias was corrected. GO terms with corrected _P_ < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by DMR-related genes. To understand the high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, pathway analysis and statistical testing was conducted using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment by means of KOBAS software (Mao et al. [2005](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR32)).

### Data validation by traditional bisulfite-sequencing PCR

Traditional bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) was used to validate the WGBS data. The mixed DNA used in the WGBS was converted with bisulfite and purified according to EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit (QIAGEN, Dusseldorf, Germany) instructions. PCR was carried out on bisulfite-treated DNA using primers specific to the converted DNA sequence (forward primer sequence: TTTTGGATTTTGGAATAATATATTT; reverse primer sequence: ACATATCCACTATTTTAAAAAAACTTAA). The reference sequence (scaffold1801:18940–19215 at CGI\_10004348) was downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database (GenBank: [JH816177.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JH816177.1)). BSP was performed with 2× Vazyme Lamp Master Mix (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China), with the program at 94 °C for 3 min, then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 43 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for an additional 5-min period. The amplicons were cloned into a pEASY-T1 vector. Twenty clones for each sample were randomly selected to sequence. Unmethylated lambda DNA was used to confirm bisulfite-conversion efficiency.

### Statistical analysis

Data related to methylation level were presented as mean ± standard error of mean, and were examined for normality by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and for homogeneity by the Levene test. Significant differences in methylation level among the four groups were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Principal component analysis was performed to explore the pattern of methylation level using the function princomp. Last, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the pheatmap package in R software.

## Results

### Global methylation pattern of different tidal oysters

Sequencing of the samples yielded 77 million reads on average, and 23 million of these reads (30%) from the library were mapped after quality control and alignment. Approximately 54% of the total clean reads had >5× coverage across the genome (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Tab1)). The details of coverage in 12 samples were listed in Table [S1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM2). In the control groups, on average, 15.0% and 14.5% of CpGs were methylated in intertidal and subtidal oysters, respectively. InH showed significantly lower global methylation levels (13.4%) than InC ( _P_ < 0.05), whereas SubH exhibited a slightly higher methylation level (15.4%) than SubC (Fig. [1a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig1)). In addition, on average, 0.20% of CHG and 0.16% of CHH were methylated in control oysters. In this study, methylation in CpG motifs was only investigated, if not particularly indicated. As shown in Fig. [1b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig1), samples did not cluster according to the heat-stress treatment, but rather by their habitat tidal levels. The methylation profiles obtained from intertidal and subtidal samples clustered, except two of the subtidal samples under heat stress, which diverged from the others. The divergence between the two tidal-level samples can be easily recognized from the PC1 cluster (Fig. [1c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig1)). Furthermore, PC2 reflected the differentiation of heat stress and control conditions, with intertidal and subtidal samples displayed in an inverted position. DAPC plot (Fig. [1d](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig1)) also showed clear differentiation between intertidal and subtidal oysters in response to heat shock. The intertidal oysters presented lower methylation under heat shock, while subtidal oysters showed the opposite. Significantly, differentiation of the shift response to heat shock was detected between the two tidal oysters (MCMC _P_ < 0.05).

### Estimation of genotypic effect on methylation diversity

To access the genetic influence on methylation, we identified SNPs from WGBS reads, and calculated the correlation between genotype and epigenotype according to the method proposed by Liew et al. ( [2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR26)). Pairwise genotypic correlation analysis showed that oysters from the same tidal clustered, indicating that they are more genetically similar (Fig. [2a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig2)). In order to investigate the genetic effect on methylation, the correlation between _F_ ST and methylation-level difference of the two tidal oysters was examined (Fig. [2b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig2)). Our results showed that there was very weak correlation in gene body ( _r_ = 0.02) and exon ( _r_ = 0.01) regions, suggesting that the epigenetic diversity we detected in the two tidal oysters was mostly independent of genotypic.

### Correlation between DNA methylation status and gene expression levels

Figure [3a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig3) shows a positive correlation between methylation level and gene expression in the four groups. In oysters, the methylated fraction tends to consist of gene bodies, while other genomic regions exhibit less methylation (Fig. [3b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig3)). Figure [3b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig3) exhibits similar trends, with nonexpressed genes showing the lowest methylation levels, high- and medium-expression groups had relatively high methylation levels, and the low-expression group was intermediate between them. The four groups (InC, InH, SubC, and SubH) in this study showed consistent trends. Figure [3b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig3) only depicts the results of one sample (InC), and the others were displayed in Fig. [S2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM1).

### DNA methylation differentiation between oysters at two tidal levels under temperate conditions

To identify evolved divergence in DNA methylation, DMGs between InC and SubC were identified, and functional enrichment results were exhibited in Fig. [S3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM1). Here while we focus on the potential transcriptional consequences of DNA methylation, we examined the overlap genes of DMGs and different expression genes (DEGs). We tested DMGs in all contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH) for integral results. There were 90 (11.46% of DEGs) genes that overlapped with DEGs and DMGs of InC vs. SubC (Fig. [4a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig4)). The differentiation of methylation and expression level of these overlap genes is exhibited in a heatmap (Fig. [4b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig4)). We performed GO analysis on these genes; significantly enriched terms of biological process were displayed. As shown in Fig. [4c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig4), genes involved in cell–cell adhesion, carbohydrate transport, the apoptotic process, and cell death were included. Among these, six genes were identified and annotated as heat-shock protein (HSP)-related genes, with different methylation and expression variations (Table [S2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM2)).

### DNA methylation differentiation between intertidal and subtidal oysters in response to heat stress

We further compared the methylation variation under heat stress at the whole-genome level, genomic regions, and DMRs. As shown in Fig. [5a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig5), the methylation level of most CpG sites in InH was lower than those of InC, denoted by the blue middle circle for intertidal samples. In contrast, the methylation level of SubH was higher than that of SubC, denoted by the red middle circle. Similar patterns of methylation following heat stress were revealed in the different genomic regions of the promoter, exon, intron, and repeat (Fig. [5b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig5)), and in DMRs (Fig. [5c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig5)). The heatmap (Fig. [5c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig5)) presented all DMRs among the four groups. Oysters from the same vertical level (intertidal or subtidal) were clustered.

The three circles from outer to inner represented the methylation levels of the heat-stress-treated groups (InH and SubH), the differences between heat-shock and control groups (InH vs. InC and SubH vs. SubC), and the control groups (InC and SubC), respectively. The level of methylation is denoted by the darkness of the color, and the degree of the difference is represented by the heatmap. **b** Distributions of DNA methylation levels among different genomic regions. **c** Heatmap of methylation levels within different methylation regions. Darker red indicates greater methylation in an individual for that DMR, whereas darker blue indicates lesser methylation in an individual for that DMR.

There were 491 hypermethylated and 1646 hypomethylated DMGs in InH vs. InC, and 1636 hypermethylated and 823 hypomethylated DMGs in SubH vs. SubC. In total, 788 DMGs were shared between the two groups, whereas 1279 and 1554 DMGs varied uniquely in intertidal and subtidal samples, respectively, when exposed to high temperatures (Fig. [6a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig6)). The column chart exhibits the different methylation patterns between intertidal and subtidal samples.

Combined with the transcriptional data, 67 (10.65% of DEGs) and 55 (6.88% of DEGs) overlap genes were found in InH vs. InC and SubH vs. SubC, respectively (Fig. [6b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig6)). The relationship between methylation and expression level of the specific genes in InH vs. InC and SubH vs. SubC (Fig. [S5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM1)) is displayed as a scatterplot. Many of the genes in the intertidal group showed hypomethylation (77%), and 42% of genes showed downregulated expression. In contrast, genes showing hypermethylation combined with upregulated expression accounted for 62% of the genes in the subtidal group. Taken together, a positive correlation was observed between DNA methylation and gene expression, which is in accordance with the trend at the whole-genome level (Fig. [3a, b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig3)).

Only two genes were common to both groups. One is a component of the HSP gene (CGI\_10004348), which encodes heat-shock 70-kDa protein 12A (HSPA12A), and showed upregulated expression in the two groups under heat shock. However, the methylation varied: intertidal samples showed a positive relationship with expression, whereas subtidal samples showed the opposite (Fig. [S6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM1)). To validate the WGBS data, a target area containing eight CpGs (276 bp, scaffold1801:18940–19215) on HSPA12A was selected according to the results shown in Integrative Genomics Viewer (Fig. [S7a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM1)) to carry out BSP. The bisulfite-conversion rates represented by the percentage of unmethylated lambda DNA were over 99%. As shown in Fig. [S7b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM1), InC was almost unmethylated within the eight CpGs, while InH exhibited higher methylation levels. Similarly, SubH showed higher methylation levels than SubC. These results indicated that the traditional bisulfite-sequencing results were in good accordance with the WGBS data. The function of the other common gene (CGI\_10002343) was not annotated, and both the expression and methylation level of this gene decreased in the two groups when faced with high temperatures (Fig. [S6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM1)).

Specific genes in InH vs. InC were found to participate in regulation of the apoptotic process, organism development, protein modification, and ion transport. As for subtidal-specific genes, functional categories were enriched in the oxidation-reduction process, ion homeostasis, signal transduction, and proteolysis (Fig. [6b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig6)). Details of the relevant genes are listed in Tables [S3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM2) and [S4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#MOESM2). Among the genes in InH vs. InC, two were found to participate in the apoptotic process. One (CGI\_10006605) is annotated as a caspase-like protein, the other (CGI\_10013106) is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family (Fig. [6c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig6)). Caspase activation plays a central role in the execution of apoptosis, but IAP is an inhibitor of apoptosis. CGI\_10006605 showed hypomethylation and upexpression, whereas CGI\_10013106 showed hypermethylation and downexpression (Fig. [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#Fig6) d). Both of these changes in expression contributed to apoptosis, which was negatively regulated by DNA methylation.

## Discussion

A growing number of studies have shown that a dynamic environment can lead to changes in epigenetic marks, which may influence phenotypic plasticity, and help explain the mechanisms of rapid adaptation and acclimatization in a future of rapidly changing climate (Metzger and Schulte [2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR35); Putnam et al. [2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR43); Zhang et al. [2017a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR57)). Our previous study revealed the phenotypic divergence between intertidal and subtidal oysters (Li et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR25)). In this study, divergent methylation patterns were revealed between intertidal and subtidal oysters, and the genes potentially regulated by the methylation were identified. This study dissected the heritable component of environment-induced phenotypic variation.

The methylation landscape of _C. gigas_ was investigated in this research. Approximately 15% of CpGs were identified methylated in this study. This result is in accordance with previous studies in _C. gigas_ using WGBS (Gavery and Roberts [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR13); Olson and Roberts [2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR38)). Compared with other invertebrates, this level is lower than that reported in the sea squirt ( _Halocynthia roretzi_, 29%), but higher than that in sea anemones ( _Nematostella vectensis_, 11%) (Zemach et al. [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR55)). Heat shock can cause significantly decreased and slightly increased methylation levels in intertidal and subtidal oysters, respectively, indicating that DNA methylation can be induced by acute heat shock. This result is supported by previous studies. For example, high temperature can induce significant global DNA methylation changes in _Didemnum vexillum_ (Hawes et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR18)), and any change in temperature during development and thermal acclimation in adults can increase DNA methylation levels in _Gasterosteus aculeatus_ (Metzger and Schulte [2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR35)). Consistent with previous research on oysters (Gavery and Roberts [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR13)), this study found that DNA methylation tended to be mainly located in gene bodies, with other genomic regions exhibiting less methylation.

As for the relationship between methylation and expression, we found that highly and intermediately expressed genes exhibited the highest degree of methylation in gene bodies. This observation is in agreement with previous studies in the oyster (Gavery and Roberts [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR13); Olson and Roberts [2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR38)), the honeybee (Lyko et al. [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR31)), eukaryotes (Zemach et al. [2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR55)), and mammals (Aran et al. [2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR2)), indicating that the association of hypermethylation in gene bodies with higher expression appears to be a general phenomenon. The occurrence of gene body methylation, especially in protein-coding sequences, was found that can cause deleterious amino acid substitutions (Dixon et al. [2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR8)); to compensate this risk, it was reported that gene body methylation can be altered by environmental factors, and thus balances the expression of housekeeping and environmentally responsive genes to help acclimatization (Dixon et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR7)). The divergence of phenotypic plasticity in gene expression in oysters has been investigated in a previous study, in which intertidal oysters showed higher plasticity than subtidal oysters (Li et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR25)). In accordance with this, our research on DNA methylation showed that intertidal oysters were more plastic, which implied that DNA methylation may mediate adaptive phenotypic plasticity.

Oysters derived from intertidal and subtidal areas showed epigenetic divergence. In this study, genotype showed limited influences on epigenetic differentiation between the two tidal oysters, suggesting that the methylation variation we detected was mainly induced by environment. The results of sample clustering showed that the differentiation of DNA methylation between the two groups was greater than that induced by acute heat shock, which emphasized that the mediating role of DNA methylation was strongly influenced by life history in specific environments. This phenomenon is not unexpected, considering the mechanism of DNA methylation building, which allows the stable reproduction of gene-activity states from a parental generation of cells to the next. The epigenetic modification we detected in the oyster could be a quantitative response, since the environment-induced epigenetic effect depends on the magnitude of the affecting factor, such as long-term life history or acute heat shock (Jaenisch and Bird [2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR21)). Previous studies reported that oysters inhabiting intertidal areas are considered more heat-tolerant, whereas individuals living in subtidal areas are more heat-sensitive (Diederich and Pechenik [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR6); Li et al. [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR25)). In this study, intertidal oysters mainly showed genomic hypomethylation, while subtidal samples displayed hypermethylation, in response to heat shock. Interestingly, a similar reverse methylation pattern was also detected in a study of two genotypes of rapeseed seedlings, which found that more DNA demethylation events occurred in the heat-tolerant genotype, while more methylation events occurred in the heat-sensitive genotype (Gao et al. [2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR12)). The reverse methylation pattern implies that the epigenetic differentiation between the two groups of oysters in this study may result from genetic divergence, which could have resulted from post-settlement mortality when oyster larvae settled onshore, although there is a strong gene flow between intertidal and subtidal oysters at the same geographical location (Sanford and Kelly [2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR45); Schmidt and Rand [2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR46)).

The extent of the role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression may be demonstrated by 10.65% and 6.88% DMGs in DEGs in intertidal and subtidal oysters, respectively. Oysters derived from two tidal areas modulate totally different genes in response to heat shock, as intertidal oysters were engaged in apoptosis and organism development processes, while oxidation-reduction and ion homeostasis processes occurred in subtidal oysters. These results indicated that the two groups of oysters were experiencing varied response status, as found by Li et al. ( [2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR25)), who demonstrated different thermal adaptation in different geographical _C. gigas_ populations. Two affected genes related to promotion of the apoptotic process can contribute to thermal response in the intertidal samples, because studies on corals have demonstrated the involvement of apoptosis in response to rising seawater temperature, and suggested that increasing temperatures can activate caspase-dependent apoptosis in irreparable cells to improve organismal changes of survival (Kvitt et al. [2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR23); Pernice et al. [2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR40)). The expression of both genes was negatively correlated with DNA methylation, from which can be inferred that DNA methylation can suppress gene expression by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors to DNA, or by recruiting transcriptional repressor proteins (Moore et al. [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR37)). In support of this observation, a negative correlation between DNA methylation and expression of some homeobox gene orthologs during early oyster development has also been reported (Riviere et al. [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR44)). Overall, apoptotic response may play an important role in intertidal adaptation, and the DNA methylation we detected provides a new underlying mechanism.

Several genes in the HSP family were found in both intertidal and subtidal groups. A previous study reported DNA hypomethylation of the _Biomphalaria glabrata_ HSP 70 region in snails under heat shock (Ittiprasert et al. [2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR20)). However, our data showed that both hyper- and hypomethylation occur, combined with both increased and decreased expression. This result may be explained by the different habitats and treatments of the organisms. Remarkably, the gene encoding HSPA12A was the only annotated gene that showed significant methylation and expression variation in both intertidal and subtidal oysters. It has been demonstrated to participate in environmental stress-response processes by regulating gene expression in a variety of organisms, such as mussels, mice, and Japanese black cattle (Han et al. [2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR15); Masoudi et al. [2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR34); You et al. [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR53); Zhu et al. [2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7852555/#CR59)). However, little is known regarding how DNA methylation works on HSPA12A when under environmental stressors. Hence, our results not only complement the existing literature on the role of epigenetics in this gene in response to thermal stress, but also reveal the different regulatory patterns in two regional oysters.

In this study, heritable epigenetic variation was investigated by using F1 offspring subjected to common garden experiment. The divergence between the intertidal and the subtidal oysters for the multiple traits clearly suggests that the environment affects phenotypic variation, and that this adaptive phenotypic divergence may be mediated by DNA methylation that can be transmitted to the next generation. Although transgenerational environment-induced epigenetic variants have been revealed in this study, it remains unclear to what extent the epigenetic changes can stably persist across generations, and what mechanism underlies this DNA methylation erasure and re-establishment.

## Conclusion

Understanding the mechanisms regulating the capacity of organisms to respond to environmental variation is critical in determining the impacts of environmental change on populations. In this study, we used WGBS combined with RNA-seq to investigate DNA methylation features in oysters derived from different tidal areas. Our data demonstrated that DNA methylation in _C. gigas_ can be induced by environmental changes, and differentiation in methylation was detected between intertidal and subtidal oysters. In addition, the genes potentially regulated by methylation were identified. This study revealed that methylation is a mechanism underlying adaptive phenotypic divergence between the intertidal and subtidal oysters. This will facilitate a better understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms participate in environmental stress responses in marine invertebrates, and provides new avenues for resource conservation and management.

## Abstract

Delineating the relative influence of genotype and the environment on DNA methylation is
critical for characterizing the spectrum of organism fitness as driven by adaptation and
phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we integrated genomic and DNA methylation data for
two distinct Olympia oyster ( _Ostrea lurida_) populations while controlling
for within-generation environmental influences. In addition to providing the first
characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the oyster genus
_Ostrea_, we identified 3,963 differentially methylated loci between
populations. Our results show a clear coupling between genetic and epigenetic patterns of
variation, with 27% of variation in interindividual methylation differences explained by
genotype. Underlying this association are both direct genetic changes in CpGs (CpG-SNPs)
and genetic variation with indirect influence on methylation (mQTLs). When comparing
measures of genetic and epigenetic population divergence at specific genomic regions this
relationship surprisingly breaks down, which has implications for the methods commonly
used to study epigenetic and genetic coupling in marine invertebrates.

## Significance.

We know that genotype and epigenetic patterns are primarily responsible for phenotype, yet
there is a lack of understanding to what degree the two are linked. Here, we characterized
the degree by which genetic variation and DNA methylation variation are coupled in a marine
invertebrate and identified potential mechanisms, with almost a third of the methylation
variation attributable to genotype. This study provides a framework for future studies in
environmental epigenetics to take genetic variation into account when teasing apart the
drivers of phenotypic variation. By identifying methylation variation that cannot be
attributed to genotype or environmental changes during development, our results also
highlight the need for future research to characterize molecular mechanisms adjacent to
genetic adaptation for producing long-term shifts in phenotype.

## Introduction

It is increasingly evident that epigenetic processes both influence phenotype and interact
with genetic variation. One such epigenetic process is DNA methylation, which commonly
refers to the methylation of a cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide. The role of DNA methylation
is diverse across taxa and varies based on the genomic location. In most vertebrates, DNA
methylation is widespread across the genome and silences transcriptional activity when
present in the promoter regions ( [Zemach et al.\\
2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B133); [Wagner et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B121); [Varriale 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B118)). In contrast many marine
invertebrates have sparsely methylated genomes and the influence of methylation on
transcription is more complex ( [Suzuki and Bird\\
2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B112); [Roberts and Gavery 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B93); [de Mendoza et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B22)). In both vertebrates and
invertebrates, the removal and addition of methyl groups can become canalized during the
lifetime of that organism, and if occurring in germ cells has the potential to influence
subsequent generations. This heritability of DNA methylation, as well as taxa-specific
methylation rates and patterns, suggest that methylation differences arose in part due to
evolutionary forces ( [Varriale 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B118)).

While the patterns and functions of CpG methylation differ among vertebrate and
invertebrate taxa, in both systems, methylation is highly variable. The evolutionary source
of this variation is now an area of active research, with the two dominant factors appearing
to be (1) an organism's environmental history (intra- and intergenerational), and (2) its
genotype ( [Jaenisch and Bird 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B49); [Danchin et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B21); [Lienert et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B69)). Understanding how the environment and
genotype interact to influence DNA methylation is critical for delineating organism fitness
as driven by phenotypic plasticity and adaptation, particularly in the context of global
climate change. Bivalves, and oysters in particular, are a valuable model for investigating
invertebrate methylation patterns due to their experimental tractability and concordant
development of genomic resources ( [Timmins-Schiffman\\
et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B115)).

DNA methylation has been shown to vary in response to environmental factors in marine
invertebrates ( [Eirin-Lopez and Putnam 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B27)).
In oysters, differential methylation has been reported in response to ocean acidification
( [Downey-Wall et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B25); [Lim et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B72)), salinity stress ( [Zhang, Li, Kong, et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B135)), air exposure
( [Zhang, Li, Yu, et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B137)), and the
herbicide diuron ( [Akcha et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B2)). Because
there are clear associations between methylation and transcriptional activity ( [Gavery and Roberts 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B35); [Olson and Roberts 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B84); [Rivière 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B92); [Song et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B108);
[Johnson et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B53)), methylation changes
may contribute to phenotypic plasticity in response to abiotic stressors ( [Gonzalez-Romero et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B37); [Downey-Wall et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B25); [Venkataraman et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B119); [Wang et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B123), [2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B124); [Lim et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B72)). Methylation changes triggered
by the environment may themselves be heritable if they occur in gametes, leading to
transgenerational plasticity, a relationship that has been described in sea urchins ( [Strader et al. 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B111), [2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B110)). It is the dynamic characteristics of the methylome that is
fueling a growing body of research associating methylation variation with environmental
exposures, particularly in transgenerational studies ( [Eirin-Lopez and Putnam 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B27)). However, few studies have controlled
for (or described) the relationship between methylotype and genotype in test organisms, but
see ( [Kvist et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B64); [Johnson and Kelly 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52); [Wang et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B124)), likely because in nonmodel taxa, there is
limited understanding of how the methylome is shaped by the genome.

While efforts to explore the influence of genotype on DNA methylation are limited in marine
invertebrates, studies in taxa with advanced genomic resources have identified associations
between genetic variants and DNA methylation ( [Zhang\\
et al. 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B134); [Banovich et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B6);
[Taudt et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B114); [Yi 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B132)). In oysters, genes with constitutive
high levels of methylation have less genetic variation within populations ( [Roberts and Gavery 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B93)). Similar results have
been found in the honey bee _Apis mellifera_ and the jewel wasp
( _Nasonia vitripennis_; [Lyko et al.\\
2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B76); [Park et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B86). One direct
mechanism by which genetic and epigenetic variation can be associated is single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that create or remove CpG loci (CpG-SNPs), and therefore can
immediately affect local methylation status ( [Shoemaker et al. 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B101); [Zhi et al.\\
2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B139)). Alternatively, methylation status itself may change the likelihood of an SNP
from occurring by “shielding” genetic mutations from selection, allowing genetic
differentiation to accumulate ( [Klironomos et al.\\
2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B58)), and by changing rates of homologous recombination ( [Li et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B67)) and copy number variation mutation (discussed in
[Skinner et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B104)). Surprisingly, some
recent studies in oysters have found no relationship between genetic and epigenetic
differentiation among populations or breeding cohorts, resulting in the suggestion that
these two processes are uncoupled ( [Johnson and Kelly\\
2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52); [Jiang et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B51); [Wang et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B123)).

Genetic changes that are associated with methylation state but located some distance from
the associated CpG are referred to as methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). In
humans, mQTLs may contribute up to 15–20% of interindividual variation in methylation and up
to 70% of population-level methylation variation ( [Heyn et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B45); [McClay et al.\\
2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B81); [van Dongen et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B117); [Husquin et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B48)). These genetic and
epigenetic variants are often associated with complex traits or environmental differences,
such as immunity or history of tobacco exposure ( [Gao\\
et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B34); [Bonder et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B15);
[McClay et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B81)). Mechanistically, mQTLs
have been proposed to operate in a number of ways. Global methylation patterns can be
influenced by changing the expression or activity of methyltransferases, although mQTLs are
rarely found in these genes. Increasingly, transcription factors and their binding sites
have been implicated with mQTLs, as transcription factor binding can prevent methylation of
nearby CpGs ( [Héberlé and Bardet 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B43)). Under
this model, genetic variants in transcription factor–binding sites can influence local
methylation (local mQTLs), whereas genetic variants that affect the activity of wide-acting
transcription factors can influence methylation at many distant CpGs near binding sites for
that specific transcription factors (distant mQTLs). While these mechanisms have not been
investigated in most nonmodel taxa, the conserved roles of transcription factors across taxa
suggest that they may also play a role in shaping methylation variation in invertebrates and
bivalves ( [Bell et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B10); [Nitta et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B83)). Functional genomics are
needed to further investigate these relationships to ascertain the mechanisms underlying
genetic and epigenetic relationships in nonmodel taxa.

The Olympia oyster ( _Ostrea lurida_) is an emerging model taxa for
investigating the links between environment, genetic adaptation, and epigenetic plasticity
( [Timmins-Schiffman et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B115); [White et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B128); [Maynard et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B79); [Silliman 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B102)). Native to estuaries from Baja California to the central coast of
Canada, _O. lurida_ extends over strong environmental clines and mosaics
( [Schoch et al. 2006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B96); [Chan et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B19)). Significant neutral and
putatively adaptive genetic variation has been detected between populations at both regional
and local scales, which is surprising given the potential for high connectivity during the
planktonic larval phase ( [Silliman 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B102)).
Experimental tests for local adaptation among neighboring sites within San Francisco Bay, CA
( [Maynard et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B79)) and Puget Sound, WA
( [Heare et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B41); [Silliman et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B103)) have found phenotypic
variation at fitness-related traits, such as growth, salinity tolerance, and reproductive
timing. By controlling for environmental variation, these studies suggest a strong heritable
component underlying population differences. Whether this component is due to genetic
variation, inherited epigenetic modifications, or a combination is still unknown.

The objective of the current study was to leverage a new _O. lurida_ draft
genome to investigate the relationship between CpG methylation and genetic variation based
on 2b-RAD SNPs. Oysters from two populations in Puget Sound, WA were raised to maturity for
one generation in common conditions to remove lifetime exposure to environmental variation.
These populations have phenotypic variation in larval and adult size and reproductive timing
( [Heare et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B41); [Silliman et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B103); [Spencer et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B109)), show varied gene expression profiles under
stress ( [Heare et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B42)), and come from
sites with different environmental profiles in dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, salinity,
and food availability ( [Moore et al. 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B82);
[Banas et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B5); [Khangaonkar et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B56)). While some marine invertebrate studies
have associated overall patterns of epigenetic and genetic differentiation between
populations (e.g., [Johnson and Kelly 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52), to
our knowledge, this is the first to directly link epigenetic and genetic variability by
identifying and functionally characterizing CpG-SNPs and meth-QTLs.

## Results

### Study Design

Adult Olympia oysters ( _O. lurida_) derived from two separate parent
populations in Puget Sound, Washington were reared in Clam Bay, Washington. The two
parental populations were from Hood Canal and South Sound. Details on broodstock
collection and outplanting are described in [Heare\\
et al. (2017)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B41). Shell length and wet weight were measured immediately prior to
adductor tissue dissection. Biallelic SNPs were genotyped in 114 individuals (57 from each
population) using a reduced-representation 2b-RAD approach ( [Wang et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B125)) by mapping to a draft _O._
_lurida_ genome assembly (GCA\_903981925.1; 159,429 scaffolds; N50 = 12,947).
After filtering for sample coverage (at least three reads in >70% of individuals) and a
minimum overall minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.01, genotype likelihoods were calculated
with the software ANGSD (Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data) for 5,269 SNPs and
used for subsequent population genetic analyses ( [Korneliussen et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B61)).

To characterize CpG methylation patterns for the first time in an _Ostrea_
spp., we randomly selected nine genotyped individuals from each population and used
methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) bisulfite sequencing (MBD-BS). These 18 samples are
referred to as the MBD18 samples. This reduced-representation approach is efficient for
taxa with sparse methylation patterns, as it enriches for methylated DNA regions while
providing single-base resolution through bisulfite conversion ( [Trigg et al. 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B116)). Reads from all MBD18 samples were
concatenated into one “meta-sample” and aligned to the _O. lurida_ genome
to describe general methylation patterns in the Olympia oyster. Concatenating the MBD-BS
reads increased our power to detect methylated loci that may have had low coverage across
individual samples, and also minimized the influence of C-T SNPs being identified as
unmethylated Cs after bisulfite conversion ( [Liu et\\
al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B74)). Out of 2,030,624 CpG loci with at least 5× sequencing coverage in the
“meta-sample,” 1,839,241 (90.6%) were methylated, defined as loci with >50% of reads
remaining cytosines after bisulfite conversion.

For comparative methylation analyses, reads from each MBD18 sample were aligned
separately, and a more conservative set of 252,115 loci were used by filtering for loci
with 5× coverage across at least 7 of the 9 samples within each population, resulting in
median coverage 13 ± 3 ( [supplementary\\
table S1, Supplementary Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). As MBD-BS enriches for methylated
regions, this conservative filtering approach may exclude regions that were methylated in
one population but largely unmethylated in the other. Therefore, we included an additional
251 CpG loci that were minimally sequenced in one population (≤1 sample) and widely
sequenced in the other population (≥7 samples), and annotated samples with missing data in
the low-sequenced population as unmethylated at 5× coverage. Preliminary analyses were
done with a filter of 10× coverage for comparative methylation analyses, and while the
absolute number of significant CpGs was lower, qualitatively the results were similar
( [supplementary fig. S9, Supplementary\\
Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online).

### Genome Annotation and General Methylation Landscape

The draft genome assembly (Accession # GCA\_903981925.1) is 1.1 Gb in size with a contig
N50 of 7.8 kb. Gene prediction identified 32,210 genes, 170,394 exons, and 163,637 coding
sequences. Additionally, 27,331,887 CpG motifs were identified in the genome assembly.

Transposable element identification determined GC content of the genome to be 36.58%.
Retroelements comprised 6.24% of the genome assembly. Those retroelements consisted of
0.03% small interspersed nuclear elements, 5.69% long interspersed nuclear elements, and
0.53% of long terminal repeat elements. DNA transposons made up 3.13% of genome
assembly.

Of the 27,331,887 CpGs in the _O. lurida_ genome, we found that 1,839,241
were methylated (6.73%) using the concatenated MBD18 reads. Of the 1,839,241 methylated
loci 34.5% were intragenic (14.7% in exons, 19.8% in introns), 4.6% and 4.7% were located
2 kb upstream and downstream of known genes, respectively, and 13.8% were within
transposable elements. 32.3% of the methylated loci were not associated with known regions
(i.e., intergenic beyond 2 kb gene flanking regions; [fig. 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F1)). The distribution of methylated loci across genomic features differed
significantly from the distribution of all CpG loci in the _O. lurida_
genome ( _χ_ 2 = 685,890, df = 5, _P_ ∼ 0), and
methylated CpG loci were ∼3.7× more likely to be located within an exon ( [supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary\\
Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). By not excluding C-T SNPs from this analysis, we may be
underestimating methylation levels in areas with high nucleotide diversity.

Comparison of the percentages of CpGs in genome (light blue, left bar plots) versus
methylated CpG loci (dark blue, right bar plots) in _Ostrea lurida_
muscle tissue that intersect with each of the following genomic features: exon,
intron, promoter region (within 2 kb of the 5′ end of a gene), transposable element,
unknown region of genome. Compared with all CpGs in the _O. lurida_
genome methylated loci are more likely to be located in exons (3.7×) and introns
(1.4×), and less likely to be located in unknown regions (0.60×).

### Population Genetic Structure

Population genetic analyses of all 114 individuals found evidence of divergence with gene
flow between the two populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) of 5,269 SNPs
clustered individuals primarily by population of origin along PC1, which represented 4.5%
of the total variation ( [fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F2)). South sound
individuals are separated along PC2, which may suggest some intrapopulation genetic
diversity due to drift from stochastic reproductive success ( [Hedgecock and Pudovkin 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B44)). NGSadmix was used to perform an
ADMIXTURE analysis based on genotype likelihoods of 3,724 SNPs, after filtering further
for a minimum overall allele frequency of 0.05 ( [Skotte et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B105)). The most likely number of genetic clusters
( _K_) was determined to be _K_ = 2, with evidence of
admixture between the two sampled populations ( [supplementary fig. S7, Supplementary Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). Outlier
analyses with BayeScan detected 12 SNPs as potentially under divergent selection ( [Foll and Gaggiotti 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B33)). One of these SNPs was
found in a gene involved in cell mitosis (G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B) and another was
within 2 kb downstream of a gene involved in protein ubiquitination (SOCS5; [supplementary table S5, Supplementary\\
Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online).

PCA based on 5,269 SNPs for 114 individuals, with colors and shape referring to
parental population.

Population genetic differentiation ( _F_ ST) was measured overall
and separately for each SNP and each gene region (± flanking 2 kb; [Reynolds et al. 1983](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B90)). These values were derived from estimates
of the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) in ANGSD, and therefore used 5,882 SNPs that were
filtered as to avoid distorting the allele-frequency spectrum ( [Korneliussen et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B61)). Overall unweighted
_F_ ST between the two populations was 0.0596 (SD = 0.087), and
weighted _F_ ST was 0.0971. Per-SNP
_F_ ST was calculated for 5,882 SNPs, with 1,909 of these SNPs
found across 1,386 genes. Mean _F_ ST for SNPs in genes was
slightly lower than overall _F_ ST with an unweighted
_F_ ST of 0.0586 (SD = 0.084) and weighted
_F_ ST of 0.093. Thirty-eight genes had an
_F_ ST \> 0.3, and were enriched for four biological
processes, including steroid hormone-mediated signaling pathway and three processes
related to autophagy ( [supplementary\\
table S6, Supplementary Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online).

### DNA Methylation Differences Between Populations

Population methylation analyses of the MBD18 individuals found evidence of epigenetic
divergence. PCA, which was performed on a percent methylation matrix (252,366 loci × 18
samples), clustered individuals by population of origin along PC2, which represented 8.5%
of the total variation ( [fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3) _[B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3)_). Logistic regression analysis
identified 3,963 differentially methylated loci (DMLs) between populations (methylation
difference >25% and _Q_-value <0.01, [supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary\\
Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online), 1,915 of which were located within known genes (48.3% of DMLs),
and 1,504 of which were within exons (40.0% of DMLs). An additional 178 and 171 of the
DMLs were found upstream and downstream of genes (within 2 kb; 4.5% and 4.4%,
respectively), and 188 were located within transposable elements (4.7%). There were 500
DMLs that were not found in any known feature (12.6%). 54% of DMLs had higher methylation
levels in SS (2,154 loci), and 46% were higher in HC (1,809; [supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary\\
Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online).

Scatter plot of PC1 from SNP genotype data and PC2 from DNA methylation data showing

Population divergence of methylation was also assessed at the gene level for gene regions
containing ≥5 informative loci. Of the 6,299 gene regions assessed, 1,447 were
differentially methylated gene regions (DMGs) as determined by binomial generalized linear
models (GLMs). DMGs and gene regions containing DMLs were each enriched for 31 biological
processes, both of which included sarcomere organization (GO:0045214), and metabolic
process (GO:0008152) ( [supplementary\\
table S4, Supplementary Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). Mean _P_ ST,
an analog of _F_ ST, was used to measure population divergence in
methylation ( [Johnson and Kelly 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52)).
_P_ ST and _F_ ST are comparable
metrics of population divergence, as both assess the proportion of variance within a
population to the total variance, and range from 0 to 1 with increasing values indicating
more differentiation. _P_ ST averaged across 14,088 random 10 kb
bins was 0.30 ± SD 0.26.

### Relationship Between Genetic and Epigenetic Variation

To investigate the relationship between genetic and DNA methylation variation, we first
compared pairwise genetic distances between MBD18 samples with pairwise Manhattan distance
based on all filtered methylation data and found a weak, but significant relationship
(Pearson's _R_ = 0.27, _P_ = 0.00077 and Spearman's
_ρ_ = 0.22, _P_ = 0.0069; [fig. 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F4) _[A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F4)_). This correlation was stronger when comparing against Manhattan
distances based on DMLs (Pearson's _R_ = 0.73, _P_ <
2.2E10−16 and Spearman's _ρ_ = 0.70, _P_ <
2.2E10−16; [fig. 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F4) _[B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F4)_). This suggests that the rate of
genetic changes between individuals is correlated to the rate of methylation changes,
especially for CpG sites that diverge between populations. We further compared population
specificity of our data by correlating the first PC scores from SNP data (9.5% of
variation, [fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3) _[A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3)_) with the second PC scores of
methylation data (8.5%, [fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3) _[B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3)_), as these two axes clearly
separated individuals by population. These were strongly correlated (Pearson's
_R_ = −0.83, _P_ = 1.65E10−5 and Spearman's
_ρ_ = −0.86, _P_ < 2.2E10−16; [fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3) _[C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3)_), suggesting that common underlying mechanisms may be
involved in population divergence at variable genetic and epigenetic sites. However, we
found no significant correlation between _F_ ST and
_P_ ST at 827 random 10 kb genomic bins where we had
overlapping SNP and methylation data ( [fig.\\
5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F5)). By not finding a relationship between spatially linked epigenetic and genetic
sites, our results suggest that the strong correlation between genetic and epigenetic
patterns on the individual level is mediated more by distant (i.e.,

between populations) and _F_ ST (measure of genetic
divergence) for 827 random 10 kb genomic bins with both SNP and methylation data.

#### mQTL Analysis

To determine if genetic variants are associated with loci showing interindividual
methylation variation, we conducted an mQTL analysis using a linear regression model in
the R package MatrixEQTL ( [Shabalin 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B98)).
For this analysis, we used 2,860 SNPs that had a MAF > 0.05 across the MBD18 samples
as the explanatory variable, PC1-3 of SNP genotype data as a covariate to control for
ancestry, and the percent methylation at 232,567 CpG sites as the response variable.
“Local” mQTLs were determined to be SNPs within 50 kb of the CpG and an un-adjusted
_P_-value threshold of 0.01, whereas distant mQTLs were >50 kb from
the CpG or on a different scaffold and had a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of
0.05. Due to the reduced representation of our two data sets, only 10,320 CpGs (4.4% of
total) and 853 SNPs (29.8%) were within 50 kb and tested for local mQTLs. Therefore, our
discussion of local mQTL results must be interpreted conservatively, as we are likely
missing many local mQTL relationships. Results of the mQTL analysis are summarized in
[table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-T1), with 1,985 SNPs (69.4%)
detected as mQTLs and 7,157 CpGs (3.1%) associated with an mQTL. Due to linkage
disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs as well as our reduced-representation genetic sequencing,
most of these SNPs are unlikely to be the actual causal variant influencing the
methylated site. Therefore, we follow the recommendation of [McClay et al. (2015)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B81) and evaluate the methylated sites
associated with genetic variants, rather than the specific SNPs themselves, as a better
representation of genetic influence on the methylome.

Compared with background rates, local mQTLs were overrepresented in gene regions (83
annotated genes, 67% vs. 37%, _P_ = 8.665E−16), as were their associated
CpGs (78% vs. 59%, _P_ = 7.23E−9; [supplementary fig. S8, Supplementary Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). Genes
containing these sites were functionally enriched for the GO term “DNA repair” (8.7% of
genes), InterPro term “SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex” (3.6%), and UP keywords
“transcription regulation” (16.8%) and “disease mutation” (18%), among other functions.
Distant mQTL SNPs were found in 309 genes but were not enriched for any functional
categories. The CpG loci associated with distant mQTLs were found in 1,809 annotated
genes and enriched for the COG category “RNA processing and modification” (0.7% of
genes), 49 GO categories including “transcription DNA-templated” (12.1%), “mRNA
processing” (2.6%), “covalent chromatin modification” (2.4%), “regulation of
translational initiation” (0.66%), “chromatin remodeling” (1.1%), nucleic acid binding
(5.7%), chromatin binding (3.8%), and “transcription factor activity”(3.8%), as well as
87 UP keywords and sequence features including “phosphoprotein”(49.7%), “nucleus”
(33.2%), “acetylation” (22%), “RNA-binding” (6.7%), “methylation” (6.4%), and “chromatin
regulator” (3.9%). Some genes containing these distantly controlled CpGs include 7
different RNA-binding motif proteins, 6 RNA polymerase genes, 8 DEAD-box-type helicases,
17 eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eif) genes, and 6 SWI/SNF regulator of
chromatin. While most other enrichment tests presented here were not significant after
Benjamini FDR correction ( _P_ < 0.1), 17 (10%) of the enriched
functions for CpGs with distant mQTLs were significant ( [supplementary file 2, Supplementary\\
Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online).

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms that create or remove CpGs (CpG-SNPs) may contribute to
individual differences in methylation, and therefore lead to mQTL associations or
correlations between genetic and epigenetic distances. Identifying SNPs directly from
bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing data can be challenging, as bisulfite treatment removes
C-T polymorphisms. For our study, we used an independent sequencing approach (2b-RAD) to
identify potential CpG-SNPs. We identified 651 CpG-SNPs (12.4%) from our full set of
5,269 SNPs through mapping to our draft genome. CpG-SNPs were more likely to be within
350 bp of a methylated CpG than non-CpG-SNPs (40.9% vs. 34.5%, _P_ =
0.00161), when using all CpGs in the genome as the background. This 350 bp window size
represents the maximum length of a library fragment, and therefore is the maximum
distance at which a CpG-SNP could directly affect our measure of methylation. CpG-SNPs
were slightly more likely to be within 350 bp of a DML than non-CpG-SNPs (0.9% vs. 0.4%,
_P_ = 0.04086), suggesting that CpG-SNPs only play a minor role in
creating DMLs. More of the methylated sites with local meth-QTLs had a CpG-SNP compared
with distant mQTLs (12 vs. 8, _P_ = 1.508e−13). Due to the sparse genetic
sequencing of the genome, we are likely missing many CpG-SNPs associated with both local
and distant mQTLs.

We investigated the spatial overlap between population DMLs and CpGs associated with
local mQTLs, and found CpGs with local mQTLs were more likely to overlap with DMLs than
CpGs without an mQTL association (24.1% vs. 15.9%, _P_ = 0.001289). Genes
of particular interest included PRICKLE2 (developmental processes, linked to growth in
_Crassostrea gigas_ \[ [Takeuchi\\

\[ [Lipkin et al. 2000](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B73)\]). Examples of two
local mQTLs that are also a DML are shown in [figure 6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F6). A significantly lower proportion of distant mQTLs were associated
with DMLs (9.5%, _P_ = 1.243e−8). Of these 655 sites, 363 were in 311
genes, which were enriched for numerous processes relative to all distant mQTL genes,
including functions related to development, immune response, transcription factor
activity, and coiled coil domains. Unlike local mQTLs, distant mQTLs were deficient in
DMLs relative to nondistant mQTLs (9.5% vs. 14%, _P_ < 2.210e−16).

## Discussion

Research primarily from humans and plants have shown that both environment and ancestry can
influence variation in DNA methylation; however, these associations are still not fully
understood in less studied taxa such as marine invertebrates. In this study, we describe the
genotype × epigenotype relationship by integrating high-throughput genomic and methylation
data for two distinct oyster populations raised in the same environment for one generation.
In addition to providing the first characterization of genome-wide methylation patterns in
the oyster genus _Ostrea_, our results show a clear association between
genetic and epigenetic patterns of variation. Underlying this association are both direct
genetic changes in CpGs (CpG-SNPs), and mQTLs with indirect functional influence on
methylation. The association between genetic and epigenetic patterns breaks down when
comparing measures of population divergence at specific genomic regions, suggesting that
individual variation can outweigh population-level variation when comparing these patterns
at local genomic scales.

### General DNA Methylation Patterns

_Ostrea lurida_ CpG methylation is disproportionately found in gene bodies.
When compared with all CpG loci in the genome, _O. lurida_ methylation is
∼3.7× more likely to occur in exons, and ∼1.4× more likely to occur in introns ( [fig. 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F1), [supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). Gene body
methylation has also been reported for the Eastern oyster ( _Crassostrea_
_virginica_; [Downey-Wall et al.\\
2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B25); [Johnson and Kelly 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52);
[Venkataraman et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B119)), Pacific
oyster ( _C. gigas_; [Gavery and\\
Roberts 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B35); [Wang et al. 2014,\\
2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B123); [Song et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B108)), Hong
Kong oyster ( _C. hongkongensis_; [Lim et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B72)), and pearl oyster ( _Pinctada fucata martensii_;
[Zhang et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B138)). The precise role and
function of gene body methylation is not yet clear. However, in contrast to the
suppressive role of promoter methylation in vertebrates, gene body methylation in
invertebrates is hypothesized to mediate transcriptional activity because it is positively
associated with gene expression ( [Roberts and\\
Gavery 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B93)). Without expression data, we cannot directly assess the relationship
between genic methylation and transcription in _O. lurida._ However, the
high preponderance for methylation in _O. lurida_ exons, and to a lesser
extent introns, supports a role in mediating alternative splicing activity. That
methylated genes in the _O. lurida_ genome are enriched for a variety of
biological processes, including those related to cell cycle and biogenesis, DNA, RNA and
protein metabolism, transport, and stress response ( [supplementary table S3, Supplementary\\
Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online), supporting the theory that methylation regulates both
housekeeping and inducible processes in marine invertebrates.

### Epigenetic and Genetic Population Structure

#### Population-Specific Methylation Patterns

Global DNA methylation patterns in _O. lurida_ are influenced by
population of origin ( [fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3) _[B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3)_), despite rearing oysters in
common conditions. To examine biological functions associated with differential
methylation among these populations, we performed enrichment analyses on both the 1,447
DMGs and genes containing the 3,963 DMLs ( [supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). DMGs and
genes containing DMLs were both enriched for biological processes involved in transport,
cell adhesion and migration, protein ubiquitination, and sarcomere organization. DMGs
were also enriched for 27 other processes, including several related to reproduction
(e.g., germ-cell development, lipid storage, oogenesis), and growth (e.g., cell
morphogenesis, epithelium development, regulation of neurogenesis, and growth). The two
focal populations have distinct abiotic stress tolerances, as well as reproductive and
growth strategies, some of which have been shown to be transgenerational ( [Heare et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B41); [Silliman et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B103); [Spencer et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B109)). As gene expression is associated with methylation status
in oysters ( [Gavery and Roberts 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B35);
[Johnson et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B53)), protein-coding
genes identified here with population-specific methylation rates are good candidates for
future studies exploring epigenetic control of phenotype in marine invertebrates.

Our methylation data are biased toward hypermethylated loci (average proportion
methylation for loci with 5× coverage is ∼80%, and only 2.5% of sequenced loci had no
methylated reads; [supplementary fig.\\
S1, Supplementary Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). This type of data is excellent for
characterizing the methylation landscape, but does limit our ability to compare loci
where methylation varies significantly among populations (e.g., loci that are
hypermethylated in one population, but hypomethylated in the other). To partially
mitigate this concern, we implemented a filtering approach that is atypical of MBD-BS
studies in order to include some such divergently methylated loci that may be missed
with otherwise strict data filtering. Of these 251 included loci, 246 were DMLs and 17
were associated with distant mQTLs, supporting this choice when going forward with
comparative MBDseq or MBD-BS. It is worth noting that MBD-BS does enrich for regions of
the DNA that are methylated and may provide a dampened resolution on methylation
differences, so future studies should be aware that absolute comparisons about the rate
of change of DNA methylation versus nucleotides would be more accurate using
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). As the cost of sequencing decreases, other
sequencing methods (e.g., WGBS) should be used to detect additional regions where
methylation differs substantially. However, by detecting population-specific epigenetic
differences, our results contribute to the limited number of studies from
_Crassostrea_ oyster species that also found population-specific ( [Zhang et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B136); [Johnson and Kelly 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52)) or family-specific methylation patterns
( [Olson and Roberts 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B84)). In contrast
to these previous studies, the present study controls for changes to the methylome that
could arise due to differing environments during development. Therefore, the observed
population-specific methylation patterns reflect either heritable methylation
differences, or those acquired as germ cells in the parental environments.

#### Population Genetic Variation

Low but significant population genetic divergence had previously been described for
Olympia oyster populations in Puget Sound using de novo genotype-by-sequencing and
2b-RAD data ( [Silliman et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B103); [Silliman 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B102)). The current study validates
these findings using a reference-based 2b-RAD approach and 5,269 SNPs, finding weak
( _F_ ST = 0.059), but significant genetic differentiation
( [fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F2), [supplementary fig. S7, Supplementary\\
Material](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#sup1) online). Similar genetic differentiation patterns are observed for
other bivalve species on comparable spatial scales, such as the Eastern oyster
( _C. virginica_) and the Pacific oyster ( _C. gigas_;
[Kawamura et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B55); [Johnson and Kelly 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52)). Given the potential
for gene flow between neighboring oyster populations during the planktonic larval stage,
the continued evidence for population genetic differentiation suggests that either
larvae do not disperse as far as would be predicted ( [Shanks 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B100); [Pritchard\\
et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B88)), or that adaptive and neutral processes can override the effects
of gene flow for some parts of the genome ( [Weersing and Toonen 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B127); [Sanford and\\
Kelly 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B94)).

A benefit of using a reference genome in this study is the ability to also evaluate
functional patterns of genetic divergence. SNPs in genes had lower mean
_F_ ST than the genome-wide average, which aligns with
expectations of gene bodies in general showing higher sequence conservation due to
purifying selection ( [Kimura 1983](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B57)). Two
gene regions contained outlier SNPs, and therefore may be under divergent selection:
G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B and SOCS5. G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B is associated with
gametogenesis in _C. gigas_ ( [Dheilly et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B23)), as well as tidally influenced gene expression changes in
the mussel _Mytilus californianus_ ( [Gracey et al. 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B38)). SOCS5, a member of the cytokine signaling
family, is highly expressed in hemocytes, gills, and the digestive gland of _C._
_gigas_ ( [Li et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B68)). Our
2b-RAD SNPs only represented 1,386 genes out of 32,211 in the genome, and therefore our
outliers are likely only a fraction of genes diverging between these populations ( [Lowry et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B75)). Nevertheless, these genes
should be added to a growing list of candidate loci to investigate further for local
adaptation in the Olympia oyster ( [Heare et al.\\
2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B42); [Maynard et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B79); [Silliman 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B102)).

### Associations Between Methylation Patterns and Genetic Variation

Previous studies associating genetic variation and DNA methylation patterns in marine
invertebrates mainly compared measures of population divergence (e.g.,
_F_ ST and _P_ ST) at overlapping
genomic regions, and found little or no relationship ( [Johnson and Kelly 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52); [Liew et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B71); [Wang et al.\\
2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B123)). In the current study, we also found no relationship between
_F_ ST and _P_ ST for overlapping
genomic regions. However, by further comparing genome-wide summary statistics and PCAs at
the individual level, we revealed the significant relationship between interindividual
patterns in methylation and genetic variation, with 27% of variation in interindividual
methylation differences explained by genetic distance. Similar analyses have found
significant correlations in reef-building coral ( [Dimond and Roberts 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B24)) and humans ( [Carja et al. 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B18)). By only focusing on measures of population differentiation,
previous marine invertebrate studies may have missed couplings between methylation and
genetic patterns. There are three nonexclusive scenarios that could explain the observed
relationship between genetic and epigenetic patterns: (1) genetic state results in
methylation change (e.g., CpG-SNPs), (2) methylation state results in genetic change, and
(3) epigenetic and genetic changes occur in parallel due to independent molecular
mechanisms, but are associated through either physical linkage or shared evolutionary
pressures ( [fig. 7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F7)).

Molecular and evolutionary mechanisms linking genetic variation and methylation
variation. DNA mutations can change or create methylation epialleles at CpGs, either
directly through CpG-SNPs, or indirectly through the creation of local or distant
mQTLs. Some of these mQTL associations will be spurious, due to LD with CpG-SNPs or
other mQTLs. Methylation epialleles can be created or changed by stochastic
epimutations or external signals from the environment. Methylation status in turn can
change the rate of DNA mutations at a local scale. Observed epigenetic and genetic
associations may instead be due to independent molecular mechanisms that occur in
parallel due to shared evolutionary pressures.

CpG-SNPs have been implicated as important drivers of genome–epigenome interactions in
vertebrates, either by removing a CpG site on one or both strands and directly disrupting
methylation, or by influencing local methylation activity ( [Zhi et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B139); [McClay\\
et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B81)). A considerable proportion of the SNPs in our study were CpG-SNPs
(12.3%), 40.1% of which were within 350 bp of a methylated CpG, and therefore capable of
influencing our MBD-BS measurements. The enrichment of CpG-SNPs associated with methylated
CpGs supports the hypothesis that methylation could have preceded and induced genetic
variation by altering genome stability and mutation rates ( [Flores et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B32); [Ritter and Niederhuth 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B91)). Methylated cytosines readily mutate to thymine by
deamination, which results in an overall depletion of CpG dinucleotides ( [Coulondre et al. 1978](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B20); [Bird 1980](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B13); [Schorderet and\\
Gartler 1992](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B97)). For instance, in the Pacific oyster _C. gigas_
mutation rate is biased toward GC->AT, particularly at methylated CpG sites, and in
coding regions ( [Song 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B107)), and genes
predicted to have low levels of methylation (analyzed in silico using the established CpG
observed/expected relationship) are less genetically diverse (analyzed via SNPs; [Roberts and Gavery 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B93)). The higher mutability
of methylated cytosines compared with those that are unmethylated is therefore a likely
mechanism by which DNA methylation can influence genetic variants. Alternatively, some
CpG-SNPs may have preceded methylation and led to beneficial methylation variation, in
which case they may be associated with mQTLs.

High-density methylome and genotyping studies in model taxa have determined that a
substantial proportion of variably methylated sites are influenced by nearby mQTL SNPs
(i.e., under local genetic control; [Yi\\
2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B132)). To our knowledge, this is the first mQTL analysis in a marine
invertebrate. We found 7,166 of tested CpGs were under genetic control, either locally
(2.3%) or distantly (3.0%). This is lower than that found for human blood cells (15%
local, 0.08% distant; [McClay et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B81))
and _Arabidopsis thaliana_ (18%; [Dubin et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B26)), although our study has much lower coverage in both
methylation and genetic data. The McClay human study also found that 97.7% of SNPs were
local meth-QTLs, which is much higher than the 21% found in our study. One likely
explanation for this is the highly fragmented status of our draft genome, with 158,535
scaffolds under 50 kb in length. It is likely that some SNPs within 50 kb of a CpG were
actually tested as distant mQTLs. Our mQTL analysis is also limited by a small sample
size, which may inflate our rate of false positives for SNPs with lower MAFs ( [Huang et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B46)). We were further unable to
filter our local mQTLs results by an FDR threshold, as there were only five local mQTLs
with an FDR < 0.1. For this reason, we do not discuss the effect sizes of different
mQTLs, as these estimates are likely underpowered, and we caution against over
interpretation of the functional significance of specific local mQTLs without validation
in a larger sample size. While our mQTL analysis is not entirely comparable with larger
scaled studies in humans and plants, it nevertheless shows that associations with genetic
variants can be a significant source of variation in methylation, and should therefore be
investigated further with whole-genome genotyping. CpG-SNPs are one possible mechanism
underlying local mQTLs, and we do see an enrichment of CpG-SNPs in local mQTLs compared
with distant mQTLs. This result has also been seen in model organisms and humans; however,
in those cases, CpG-SNPs contributed to over 75% of local mQTLs ( [McClay et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B81)).

For mQTLs that lack CpG-SNPs, alternative mechanisms must be considered. Binding of
transcription factors has been linked to changes in local methylation levels, for example,
a loss of methylation upon transcription factor binding ( [Héberlé and Bardet 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B43)). In this framework, an SNP within a
transcription factor–binding site may affect methylation locally, whereas an SNP that
affects the expression or activity of transcription factors could generate changes in
methylation wherever the transcription factor binds ( [Lienert et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B69); [Martin-Trujillo et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B77)). Our functional enrichment tests suggest this
mechanism may be acting in _O. lurida_ by finding genes with mQTL SNPs
enriched for “DNA-binding” and “transcription regulation,” and five distant mQTL SNPs
within genes involved in transcription factor complexes. Genetic differences that affect
binding of different chromatin classes have also been shown to modulate local methylation
patterns ( [Jeffery and Nakielny 2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B50); [Banovich et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B6)). One particularly exciting
result is that genes containing distantly associated CpGs were highly enriched for RNA
processing and binding functions, including multiple RNA-binding motif proteins and
DEAD-box RNA helicases. DEAD-box RNA helicases are known to co-regulate transcription
factors and contribute to chromatin remodeling in multicellular organisms, although the
exact molecular mechanisms are still unclear ( [Giraud et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B36)). They have also been linked to epigenetic control of abiotic
stress-responsive transcription factors in plants through an RNA-directed DNA methylation
pathway ( [Barak et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B9)). More research
integrating chromatin annotations (e.g., ATACseq), CpG methylation, genetic diversity, and
gene expression are required to begin elucidating how these mechanisms interact to drive
phenotypic divergence.

To confidently state that epigenomic variation is under genetic control for all detected
local mQTLs, one assumes that epigenetic inheritance by other means is absent. If
epigenetic marks can be inherited between generations, then associations with local
genetic variants may simply be due to LD between the segregating epiallele and nearby
SNPs. Epigenetic inheritance is well characterized in plants ( [Taudt et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B114)), and there is evidence of environmentally
driven epigenetic changes that persist across generations in corals and oysters, although
the mechanisms of invertebrate epigenetic inheritance is still not understood ( [Downey-Wall et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B25); [Johnson et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B53); [Venkataraman et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B119); [Wang et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B123); [Akcha et\\
al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B2); [Lim et al. 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B72)). It is
also possible that genetic variants and epialleles may be under parallel selection due to
phenotype–genotype interactions, which may lead to a spurious mQTL association ( [Taudt et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B114); [Schmid et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B95)). However, since epialleles can undergo both
forward and backward changes, epimutation rates are much higher than DNA mutations and
therefore spurious mQTL associations will break down rapidly. Comparing mQTL analyses
between generations would help identify both the heritability of CpG methylation and the
consistency of mQTL results.

### Evolutionary Implications

Many marine invertebrates with large ranges experience spatial heterogeneity in abiotic
and biotic factors that lead to population-level divergence in fitness-related traits
( [Sanford and Kelly 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B94)). This
environmentally driven divergence may be facilitated through phenotypic plasticity,
selection for locally favorable genotypes, or a combination. Here, we were able to examine
the primary molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity and adaptation: epigenetic
modifications and genetic variation. Interestingly, in this system we found a clear
coupling of the two, with 27% of individual epigenetic variation attributable to genetics.
This result has profound implications for studies of both evolutionary processes and
molecular machinery. First, studies of plasticity and epigenetic variation among groups
from different environments must also account for genetic variation, rather than
attributing all differences to the environment. Second, as genetic variation is clearly
heritable, our results suggest that some proportion of DNA methylation (and likely
associated phenotypes) are also heritable. Finally, despite our two populations being
raised in the same environment, 73% of the epigenetic variation in our system was not
attributable to genetics. Characterizing the basis of this additional epigenetic
diversity, such as a historical influence of the environment or independent heritable
mechanisms, will identify avenues adjacent to genetic adaptation for producing long-term
shifts in phenotype.

## Materials and Methods

### Draft Genome Assembly and Annotation

To facilitate the analysis of genetic and epigenetic data, a draft genome for the Olympia
oyster was developed using a combination of short-read sequence data (Illumina HiSeq4000)
combined with long-read sequence data (PacBio RSII) using PBJelly (PBSuite\_15.8.24; [English et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B28)). Short reads (NCBI SRA:
SRP072461) were assembled using SOAPdenovo ( [Li et\\
al., 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B66)). The scaffolds ( _n_ = 765,755) from this assembly were
combined with the PacBio long-read data (NCBI SRA: SRR5809355) using PBJelly
(PBSuite\_15.8.24). Assembly with PBJelly was performed using the default settings. Only
contigs longer than 1,000 bp were used for further analysis. Genome assembly parameters
were compiled using QUAST (v4.5; [Gurevich et al.\\
2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B39)).

Genome annotation was performed using MAKER (v.2.31.10; [Campbell et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B16)) configured to use message passing interface
(MPI). A custom repeat library for use in MAKER was generated using RepeatModeler
(open-1.0.11; [Smit and Hubley 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B106)).
RepeatModeler was configured with the following software: RepeatMasker (open-4.0.7;
configured with Repbase RepeatMasker v20170127 ( [Bao\\
et al. 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B8)), RECON (v1.08; [Bao and Eddy\\
2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B7)) with RepeatMasker patch, RepeatScout (v1.0.5; [Price et al. 2005](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B87)), and RepeatMaskerBlast (RMBLast \[2.6.0\])
configured with the isb-2.6.0+-changes-vers2 patch file, and TRF (v4.0.4; [Benson 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B12)).

MAKER was run on two high-performance computing nodes (Lenov NextScale, E5-2680 v4 dual
CPUs, 28 cores, 128GB RAM) on the University of Washington's shared scalable compute
cluster (Hyak) using the icc\_19-ompi\_3.1.2 module (Intel C compiler v19, Open MPI v3.1.2).
An Olympia oyster transcriptome assembly was used for EST data. Protein data used were a
concatenation of NCBI proteomes from _C. gigas_ and _C._
_virginica_. Ab initio gene training was performed twice using the included SNAP
software ( [Korf 2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B60)). Functional protein
annotation was performed using BLASTp (v.2.6.0+; [Altschul et al. 1990](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B3)) against a UniProt SwissProt BLAST database (FastA file
formatted using BLAST 2.8.1+) downloaded on 01/09/2019. The MAKER functions
\`maker\_functional\_gff\` and \`maker\_functional\_fasta\` both used the same UniProt SwissProt
BLAST database. Protein domain annotation was performed using InterProScan 5 (v5.31-70.0;
[Jones et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B54)). Code and data files
used for genome annotation are available in the accompanying repository [https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen](https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen).

### Experimental Design

DNA was extracted from adductor muscle tissue from 184 individuals (88 from Hood Canal
and 96 from Oyster Bay), using E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit with RNase A treatment (Omega)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA quality was examined on a 1% TAE agarose
gel and DNA concentration was determined using the dsDNA BR Assay Kit on a Qubit 2
fluorometer (Invitrogen).

### Genetic Analysis

#### 2bRAD Sequencing and Genotyping

Using a 2b-RAD reduced-representation sequencing approach ( [Wang et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B125)), we sequenced 184 individuals and 53
technical replicates from the two Puget Sound populations for a total of 237 samples
across 4 lanes of 50 bp single-end Illumina HiSeq2500 and 1 HiSeq4000 lane. The
frequent-cutter restriction enzyme AlfI was used with modified adaptors (5′-NNR-3′) to
target one-fourth of all AlfI restriction sites in the genome. We followed the 2bRAD
library protocol developed by Eli Meyer (available at [https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen](https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen)), except that we used 900 ng
of starting DNA, 19 PCR cycles as determined by a test PCR, and we concentrated the
final pooled libraries using a Qiagen PCR kit prior to sequencing. Sequencing and sample
demultiplexing was performed by GENEWIZ for the four HiSeq2500 lanes and the University
of Chicago's Functional Genomics Center for the one HiSeq4000 lane. Sequencing of some
of these samples was previously described in [Silliman et al. (2018)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B103).

Scripts by Mikhail Matz were used for quality filtering, read trimming, and mapping to
the reference genome ( [https://github.com/z0on/2bRAD\_denovo](https://github.com/z0on/2bRAD_denovo)). Read trimming was performed by
cutadapt ( [Martin 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B78)). Samples were
retained for mapping to the genome and genotyping if they had >1.3 million reads
after filtering. Samples were mapped to the genome using Bowtie2 with the –local option
( [Langmead and Salzberg 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B65)). Genotype
likelihoods were calculated using ANGSD ( [Korneliussen et al. 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B61)) with the following filters: no triallelic sites,
_P_-value that SNP is true 1e−3, minimal mapping quality 20, minimal
base quality 25, minimal number of genotyped individuals 80 (∼70% of individuals passing
filter), minimal number of reads at a site 3, minimum _P_-value for
strand bias 1e–5, and minimum overall allele frequency 0.01. This filtering retained 114
samples and 5,269 SNPs.

#### Genetic Distance, PCA, Admixture

The genotype likelihoods produced by ANGSD were used for examining population genetic
structure and estimating pairwise genetic distance. NGSadmix was used to perform an
ADMIXTURE analysis based on genotype likelihoods of 3,724 SNPs, after filtering further
for a minimum overall allele frequency of 0.05 ( [Skotte et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B105)). The most likely number of genetic clusters
( _K_) was determined using the ( [Evanno et al. 2005](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B30)) method by running NGSadmix 10× for each value of
_K_, with _K_ ranging from 1 to 5, and then uploading
the results to Clumpak ( [Kopelman et al.\\
2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B59)). The _q_-values for the best _K_ were
plotted in R. Pairwise genetic distances between all individuals were estimated using
ngsDist with default parameters ( [Vieira et al.\\
2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B120)). A matrix of genetic distances for the MBD18 samples was subsetted and
used for comparative analyses with methylation data.

For a PCA of all samples, we used ANGSD to estimate a covariance matrix by sampling a
single read at each polymorphic site using the same filtering parameters as previously
described. We then performed an eigenvalue decomposition on the matrix and plotted the
PCA in R. For the PCA on only the MBD18 samples, we subsetted the covariance matrix and
ran an eigenvalue decomposition on those samples alone.

To detect SNPs under putative directional selection, we used qctool v2.0 ( [https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/∼gav/qctool\_v2/](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/qctool_v2/)) to convert our genotype
likelihoods to a Variant Call Format (VCF) file of SNPs with >90% confidence. SNPs
with <90% confidence were coded as missing. We used BayeScan v2.1 ( [Foll and Gaggiotti 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B33)) with 1:10 prior
odds, 100,000 iterations, a burn-in length of 50,000, a FDR of 10%, and default
parameters. Results were visualized in R.

To measure population genetic differentiation ( _F_ ST), we
used the realSFS command in ANGSD to estimate the SFS separately for each population,
then calculated the 2D-SFS which was used as a prior for estimating the joint
allele-frequency probabilities at each site. In order to avoid distorting the
allele-frequency spectrum, we did not filter our data based on the
_P_-value that an SNP was true or for minimum allele frequency. We then
filtered out potential lumped paralogs sites by removing sites where heterozygotes
likely compromised more than 75% of all genotypes. This filtering strategy resulted in
363,405 sites and 5,882 SNPs. Global _F_ ST between populations
and per-site _F_ ST was calculated using ANGSD, based on ( [Reynolds et al. 1983](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B90)). A weighted
_F_ ST estimate was calculated for each gene by including all
SNPs within ±2 kb of an annotated gene region.

### DNA Methylation

#### MBD-BS Library Preparation and Alignment

DNA was isolated from adductor tissue using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit (Omega) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 18 samples were extracted for DNA methylation
analysis, 9 from the Hood Canal population and 9 from the Oyster Bay population. Samples
were sheared to a target size of 350 bp using a Bioruptor 300 (Diagenode) sonicator.
Fragmentation was confirmed with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Methylated DNA was
selected using the MethylMiner Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions for a single, high-salt elution. Samples were sent to
ZymoResearch for bisulfite conversion, and Illumina library preparation for 50 bp
single-end reads and sequencing with the Pico Methyl-Seq Library Prep Kit
(ZymoResearch). Based on the methylation rate of CHGs (where H corresponds to A, T, or
C) (∼2%), we conservatively estimate 98% conversion efficiency. Samples were multiplexed
into a single library and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina). This library
was sequenced across three lanes to achieve the desired number of reads.

Sequence quality was checked by FastQC v0.11.8 and adapters were trimmed using
TrimGalore! version 0.4.5 ( [Andrews 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B4);
[Krueger 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B62)). Bisulfite-converted
genomes were created in silico with Bowtie 2–2.3.4 (Linux x84\_64 version; [Langmead and Salzberg 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B65)) using
bismark\_genome\_preparation through Bismark v0.21.0 ( [Krueger and Andrews 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B63)). Trimmed reads were aligned to these
genomes with Bismark v0.21.0. Alignment files were deduplicated with deduplicate\_bismark
and sorted using SAMtools v.1.9 ( [Li et al.\\
2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B66)). Methylation calls were extracted from sorted deduplicated alignment
files using coverage2cystosine with –merge\_CpG parameter.

#### General DNA Methylation Landscape

To assess general methylation patterns in _O. lurida_, quality trimmed
MBD-BS reads from all samples ( _n_ = 18) were concatenated, then
re-aligned to the genome using Bismark with settings as described above. Only loci with
at least 5× coverage were examined. A cytosine locus was deemed methylated if 50% or
more of the reads remained cytosines after bisulfite conversion ( [Gavery & Roberts 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B35); [Venkataraman et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B119)). To characterize methylation
landscape, loci were intersected with the following _O. lurida_ genome
features using bedtools v2.29.0: exons, introns, gene flanking regions (2 kb upstream
and downstream), transposable elements, and unknown regions ( [Quinlan 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B89)). All CpG loci in the _O. lurida_
draft genome were similarly annotated to characterize the distribution of candidate CpG
methylation sites across features. Using _χ_ 2 contingency
tests in R, we examined whether the distribution of methylated loci across genomic
features differed from the distribution of all CpG sites in the genome
( _α_ = 0.05).

#### Comparative Methylation Analyses

Associations between _O. lurida_ population (Hood Canal, South Puget
Sound) and methylation patterns were examined by assessing DMLs and DMGs. Bismark
alignment files (.bam format) were first processed in methylKit (version 1.8.1; [Akalin et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B1)) by using
`processBismarkAln` to convert them to a
`methylRawList` object, which contains per-base methylation calls
for each sample. Loci were filtered to retain those with at minimum 5× coverage using
`filterByCoverage`, and `unite` selected
only loci that were retained across 7 of the 9 samples within each population
( _N_ = 18). Additional loci were included in the comparative analyses
to incorporate loci that were very likely unmethylated in one population but highly
methylated in the other, which is not captured in MBDSeq data due to the heavy bias for
methylated regions. This was accomplished by identifying CpG loci that were widely
sequenced in one population (data present for seven of the nine samples) and minimally
sequenced in the other population (data present for one sample or less), and assuming
that the samples with no data in the low-sequenced population were unmethylated at 5×
coverage. Global differences in methylation patterns were assessed by PCA using the
`PCASamples` function (a version of
`prcomp`), from a percent methylation matrix that was built using
`percMethylation`. A matrix of sample × sample manhattan
distances was generated from the percent methylation matrix using dist() from the stats
package for R v4.0.4 and used for comparative analyses with genetic data.

##### Differentially Methylated Loci

Differentially methylated loci were determined for each CpG locus using logistic
regression in MethylKit with `calculateDiffMeth`, and
_P_-values were adjusted to _Q_-values using the SLIM
method ( [Wang et al. 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B126)). Loci with
_Q_ < 0.01 and percent methylation difference >25% were
determined to be DMLs. CpG-SNPs were not excluded in this analysis as we are
interested in the role of genetic variation in contributing to DNA methylation
status.

##### Differentially Methylated Gene Regions

Gene regions were assessed for differential methylation among populations. Methylated
loci that overlapped with known gene regions were identified using the BEDtools
`intersectBed` function, a list of known genes that were
identified using the genome annotation tool MAKER ( [Cantarel et al. 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B17)), and expanded to include 2 kb upstream
and downstream of gene bodies using BEDtools `slopBed`. Gene
regions were assessed individually for differential methylation between oyster
populations using binomial GLMs and _χ_ 2 tests ( [Liew et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B70)).
_P_-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg method ( [Benjamini and Hochberg 1995](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B11)). Gene regions
that contained fewer than five methylated loci were discarded prior to GLM analysis.
Epigenetic divergence was estimated by _P_ ST, an analog of
_F_ ST, which assesses the proportion variance in a
quantitative trait within a population to the total variance
( _P_ ST = (VarianceTotal −
VarianceWithin)/VarianceTotal; [Johnson and Kelly 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B52)). _P_ ST was
calculated for 14,088 random 10 kb bins using
_P_ ST from the Pstat R package ( [Blondeau Da Silva Stephane 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B14)).

##### Gene-Enrichment Analyses

Differentially methylated gene regions and genes that contain DMLs were each tested
for enriched biological functions. For each gene set, gene sequences were merged with
the _O. lurida_ genome to generate a list of Uniprot IDs from annotated
genes. Enriched biological processes in each gene set were identified with the
Gene-Enrichment and Functional Annotation Tool from DAVID v6.8 as those with modified
Fisher exact _P_-values (EASE scores) < 0.1 ( [Huang et al. 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B47)).

### Comparing DNA Methylation and Genetics

To investigate the relationship between genetic and DNA methylation variation, we
compared summary statistics at both the level of the individual and genomic region for the
18 individuals where we had both genetic and epigenetic data (MBD18). First, we compared
pairwise genetic distances based on 5,269 SNPs against pairwise Manhattan distances based
on all filtered methylation data, and determined both the Pearson and Spearman
correlations in R. We also compared the distances when only using DMLs for methylation
distances ( [fig. 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F4)). We then assessed the
correlation between the first PC scores from SNP data against the second PC scores of
methylation data ( [fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-F3)). We also calculated
mean _F_ ST and _P_ ST for the 827 10 kb
genomic bins where we had both SNP and methylation data. These
_F_ ST and _P_ ST values were
calculated as previously described for gene regions, with overlapping 10 kb regions
identified with BEDtools ( [Quinlan 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B89)). To
identify CpG-SNPs in our set of 5,269 SNPs, we used the
`injectSNPsMAF` and `getCpGsetCG` functions in
the R package RaMWAS v1.18 ( [Shabalin et al.\\
2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B99)) and the package bedR v1.0.7 ( [Haider\\
et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B40)).

To determine the relationship between regions of the genome with genetic variation and
regions with interindividual methylation variation, we conducted an mQTL analysis using a
linear regression model “modelLINEAR” in the R package MatrixEQTL ( [Shabalin 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B98)). CpGs were removed if no samples had >12%
difference in methylation, resulting in 232,567 CpGs for the analysis. Methylation values
were corrected using the inverse quantile normal transformation of ranked values using
custom R code ( [McCaw et al. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B80)). A total
of 2,860 SNPs remained after filtering for those genotyped in at least 7 individuals of
both populations and with an overall MAF > 0.05. To control for ancestry, the first
three PCs of the SNP data were included as covariates in the regression model. Local mQTLs
were determined to be SNPs within 50 kb of the CpG and a _P_-value
threshold of 0.01, whereas distant mQTLs were >50 kb from the CpG or on a different
scaffold, had a _P_-value threshold of 0.01, and an FDR of 1% after
Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Summary and plotting of mQTL loci was performed in R and
ggplot2 ( [Wickham 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468963/#evad013-B129)). Gene regions
containing mQTL SNPs and their associated CpGs were analyzed for functional enrichment
with DAVID as described for DMLs; however, for the CpGs associated with distant mQTLs, we
used an EASE score cutoff of 0.05.

DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism influencing gene expression in all organisms. In metazoans, the pattern of DNA methylation changes during embryogenesis and adult life. Consequently, differentiated cells develop a stable and unique DNA methylation pattern that finely regulates mRNA transcription during development and determines tissue-specific gene expression. Currently, DNA methylation remains poorly investigated in mollusks and completely unexplored in _Mytilus galloprovincialis_. To shed light on this process in this ecologically and economically important bivalve, we screened its genome, detecting sequences homologous to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins and Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) previously described in other organisms. We characterized the gene architecture and protein domains of the mussel sequences and studied their phylogenetic relationships with the ortholog sequences from other bivalve species. We then comparatively investigated their expression levels across different adult tissues in mussel and other bivalves, using previously published transcriptome datasets. This study provides the first insights on DNA methylation regulators in _M. galloprovincialis_, which may provide fundamental information to better understand the complex role played by this mechanism in regulating genome activity in bivalves.

## Introduction

Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression. They are involved in many cellular processes, such as cellular differentiation, development, tumorigenesis, germ cell pluripotency, and inheritable genome imprinting. Accumulating evidence established that epigenetic alterations consist of a complex regulatory transcriptional pathway (DNA methylation, histone modifications, and micro-RNA mediated gene silencing) ( [Ho and Burggren, 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B38); [Becker and Workman, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B9); [Greally, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B35); [Skvortsova et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B82)). These modifications reflect the high plasticity of the genome and contribute to modify gene expression independent of DNA sequence alterations ( [Peaston and Whitelaw, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B65)). Additionally, recent evidence shows that these modifications can be passed from generation to generation in a phenomenon known as transgenerational inheritance ( [Bošković and Rando, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B13)). The major epigenetic modification is the methylation of cytosines in genomic DNA (5mC methylation), which is necessary to modulate gene expression both in specialized tissue-specific cell types and in pluripotent cells undergoing lineage-commitment. DNA methylation is an ancient mechanism shared by all living organisms, from prokaryotes to humans ( [Willbanks et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B97)). However, the leading molecular players in the context of DNA methylation often significantly differ among taxa, highlighting partial functional conservation in the landscape of methylation patterning. Vertebrate genomes are subject to high levels of DNA methylation, with a global pattern that varies from regulatory regions, promoters, and enhancers to transposable elements and gene bodies ( [Keller et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B46)). On the other hand, invertebrates DNA methylation is mostly concentrated in gene bodies ( [Zemach et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B99)), with species like _Caenorhabditis elegans_ and _Drosophila melanogaster_ mainly being free of 5mC ( [Bird et al., 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B11)).

Mollusks represent the second-largest animal phylum and the class Bivalvia includes marine organisms with high ecological and economic value due to their impact on aquaculture. Notwithstanding the growing research interest put on DNA methylation in invertebrates over the past few years, these studies are still at their infancy. The information recently gathered from bivalves have only provided a first glimpse into the basic organization of the DNA methylation in mollusks and on its interplay with the environment ( [Gavery and Roberts, 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B28), [2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B30); [Díaz-Freije et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B21); [Rivière, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B75); [Sun et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B88); [Li et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B55), [2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B54); [Saint-Carlier and Riviere, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B80); [Riviere et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B76); [Song et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B84); [Eirin-Lopez and Putnam, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B24); [Suarez-Ulloa et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B85); [Fallet et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B25); [Lim et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B56)). DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs also called “writers”), consists in the addition of a methyl-group to the 5′ position of cytosine to give methylcytosine. Among the three main DNMTs identified in metazoans, those involved in DNA methylation are DNMT1, which participates in methylation maintenance during cell division, and DNMT3, functioning primarily in _de novo_ methylation during embryonic development ( [Iyer et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B41)). On the other hand, the third DNA methyltransferase, DNMT2, does not play any role in DNA methylation in mammals, being instead involved in aspartic acid tRNA methylation ( [Goll et al., 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B33)). Its possible role in DNA methylation in other organisms, where it is the only present DNA methyltransferase, is still poorly understood ( [Ashapkin et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B6)). Another crucial mechanism, catalyzed by the ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET, also called “erasers”), is responsible for active DNA _de_ methylation ( [Tahiliani et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B89)). The recent discovery of TETs can be considered as one of the hallmarks in epigenetics, due to the key role these genes play in oncogenesis, but also in development ( [Rasmussen and Helin, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B72)). TETs have never been reported in bivalves to date. Another class of very important proteins that are believed to convert the information of methylation patterns are the methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBD), also called “readers.” These proteins, associated with other factors, play critical functions in regulating transcriptional repression and/or heterochromatin formation ( [Fatemi and Wade, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B26)). While the majority of the sequenced bilaterian genomes display the presence of at least one representative gene for each of the aforementioned classes, others, such as yeast, fruit fly, and roundworm, have entirely lost DNA methyltransferase homologs and the associated DNA methylation enzymatic activities ( [Bhattacharyya et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B10)). These losses have been occasionally reported also in some protostomes, such as the gastropod mollusk _Aplysia californica_, which lacks DNMT3 ( [Dabe et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B18)).

As of today, a comprehensive investigation of the key genes involved in the DNA methylation machinery in the marine bivalve _Mytilus galloprovincialis_ is still missing. Here, we provide the first insights on this process in this species by identifying the DNA methylation-related genes through a genome-wide analysis, studying their phylogenetic relationships and characterizing their expression pattern in different adult tissues in comparison with other bivalves.

## Materials and Methods

### Retrieval of _Mytilus galloprovincialis_ Sequences

The human sequences of DNMT1 (P26358.2), DNMT2 (O14717.1), DNMT3a (Q9Y6K1.4), DNMT3b (Q9UBC3.1), DNMT3L (Q9UJW3.3), MBD1 (Q9UIS9.2), MBD2 (Q9UBB5.1), MBD3 (O95983.1), MBD3L1 (Q8WWY6.2), MBD3L2 (Q8NHZ7.3), MBD3L3 (A6NE82.1), MBD3L5 (A6NJ08.1), MBD3L4 (A6NE82.1), MBD4 (O95243.1), MeCp2 (P51608.1), and TET1 (Q8NFU7.2) were retrieved from UniprotKB. These were used as queries for tBLASTn searches ( [Altschul et al., 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B5)) against the _M. galloprovincialis_ genome assembly, version mg10 ( [Gerdol et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B32)). Moreover, to take into account the possibility of the presence of highly divergent ortholog sequences, the same analyses were carried out using the previously reported sequences from the mollusk _Lottia gigantea_ as queries ( [Albalat, 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B2)). Missing hits were re-checked against previous versions of the same genome assembly (mg3 and mg5, more redundant, but slightly more complete) to rule out the possibility that the genes of interest were erroneously discarded during the assembly phases aimed at removing uncollapsed heterozygous genomic regions. All analyses were initially carried out using an _e_-value threshold of 1E-5, and overlapping gene annotations were translated to protein sequences to verify their reliability and completeness, based on the pairwise comparison with human queries and on the evaluation of the presence of the expected conserved domains with InterProScan 5 ( [Jones et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B44)). Predicted CDS were further validated with available assembled transcriptomes from the same species ( [Gerdol et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B31); [Moreira et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B61)), which allowed to detect and correct erroneous exon annotations. Exon and intron boundaries were therefore refined, whenever needed, through the alignment between genomic DNA and cDNA sequences with Splign ( [Kapustin et al., 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B45)). To provide a comparative overview on the architecture of DNA methylation-related genes, the genomes of _Crassostrea gigas_ ( [Zhang et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B100)), _Pomacea canaliculata_ (or the congeneric species _P. maculata_) ( [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B86)), and _Lingula anatina_ ( [Luo et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B59)) were considered as representative species for Bivalvia, non-bivalve mollusks, and non-molluscan lophotrochozoans, respectively. The accession IDs of these sequences are provided in [Supplementary Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8).

### Comparative Genomics Analyses

The validated translated amino acid sequences of _M. galloprovincialis_ were used as queries for BLASTp searches against the virtually-translated proteomes derived from all the available genomes of species belonging to the class Bivalvia. In addition, tBLASTn searches were carried out whenever no ortholog could be identified in the proteomes, to detect the presence of non-annotated partial genes. In detail, the following bivalve genomes were screened: _Argopecten irradians_ ( [Liu et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B58)), _Argopecten purpuratus_ ( [Li et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B52)), _Bathymodiolus platifrons_ ( [Sun et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B87)), _C. gigas_ ( [Zhang et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B100)), _Crassostrea virginica_ ( [Gómez-Chiarri et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B34)), _Limnoperna fortunei_ ( [Uliano-Silva et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B91)), _Magallana hongkongensis_ ( [Peng et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B66)), _Mizuhopecten yessoensis_ ( [Wang et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B94)), _Modiolus philippinarum_ ( [Sun et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B87)), _Mytilus coruscus_ ( [Li et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B53)), _Pecten maximus_ ( [Kenny et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B47)), _Pinctada fucata_ ( [Du et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B22)), _Saccostrea glomerata_ ( [Powell et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B68)), and _Scapharca broughtonii_ ( [Bai et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B7)) among Pteriomorphia; _Archivesica marissinica_ ( [Ip et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B40)), _Cyclina sinensis_ ( [Wei et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B96)), _Dreissena rostriformis_ ( [Calcino et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B14)), _Lutraria rhynchaena_ ( [Thai et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B90)), _Panopea generosa_ (unpublished), _Ruditapes philippinarum_ ( [Yan et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B98)), and _Sinonovacula constricta_ ( [Ran et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B71)) among Euheterodonta; _Megalonaias nervosa_ among Palaeoheterodonta ( [Rogers et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B77)). Details about the taxonomic classification of the species are provided in [Supplementary Table 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8). In addition, the presence of DNA methylation machinery transcripts was also assessed in the basal bivalve subclade Protobranchia: in this case, due to the lack of genomic data, tBLASTn searches were carried out in the transcriptomes of three representative species, obtained from a previously published study ( [Smith et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B83)): _Solemya velum_ (order Solemiyda), _Ennucula tenuis_ (order Nuculida), and _Yoldia limatula_ (order Nuculanida).

The genomes of other representative non-bivalve molluscan species (i.e., _P. canaliculata_, _Lottia gigantea_, _Biomphalaria glabrata_, _Aplysia californica_, and _Octopus bimaculoides_) were also similarly searched to identify ortholog sequences to be used as outgroups in subsequent phylogenetic analyses ( [Simakov et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B81); [Albertin et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B4); [Adema et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B1); [Liu et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B57)).

The best matching sequences for each species were retrieved to build a list of ortholog sequences. The correct identification of the sequences was evaluated by the assessment of primary sequence homology the presence of the expected conserved domains based on literature data. The reliability of the hits was evaluated as described above for _M. galloprovincialis_. Partial sequences unusable for downstream phylogenetic analyses \[i.e., those covering less than 50% of the length of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA)\] were replaced with assembled transcripts recovered from the NCBI SRA database, whenever available (the accession IDs of all the sequences are provided in [Supplementary Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8)). Highly fragmented sequences with unequivocal homology with the queries were marked as present, but they were not used for downstream analyses as they were not deemed to be phylogenetically informative.

### Phylogenetic Inference

Five sets of ortholog sequences (i.e., DNMT1, DNMT3, TET, MBD2/3, and MBD4) identified in Bivalvia were subject to MSA with MUSCLE v. 3.8.31 ( [Edgar, 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B23)), and highly divergent, phylogenetically uninformative regions were removed with Gblocks v.0.91b ( [Castresana, 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B15)). The refined MSA files were then analyzed with ModelTest-ng ( [Darriba et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B19)) to identify the best fitting molecular model of evolution, based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion ( [Cavanaugh, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B16)). This was found to be the Le-Gascuel model ( [Le and Gascuel, 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B49)), with a proportion of invariable sites and a gamma-shaped distribution of rate variation across sites (LG + I + G) in most cases, except MBD4 and MBD2/3, where the LG + G and JTT + G ( [Jones et al., 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B43)) models were selected, respectively. Bayesian phylogenetic inference was implemented in MrBayes v.3.2.1 ( [Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B39)), with two independent Markov Chain Monte Marco (MCMC) analyses run in parallel for one million generations each. This amount of generations was sufficient to reach convergence in all cases, as assessed by the achievement of an Effective Sample Size > 200 for all the parameters of the model with Tracer ( [Rambaut et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B70)). The resulting trees were represented with a 50% majority consensus topology, and nodes with low statistical support (i.e., <50% posterior probability) were collapsed. Non-bivalve molluscan sequences were used as outgroups for rooting purposes.

### _In silico_ Gene Expression Analysis

The expression levels of the genes of interest were calculated _in silico_ in _M. galloprovincialis_, _M. philippinarum_, _C. gigas_, _A. purpuratus_, and _M. yessoensis_ as representative species for Pteriomorphia, and _A. marissinica_ as a representative species for Heterodonta. All these species had a fully sequenced genome and tissue-specific RNA-seq sequencing libraries available ( [Supplementary Table 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8)). In detail, raw reads, downloaded from the NCBI SRA database, were mapped to the reference genomes, with high stringency (length fraction = 0.75, similarity fraction = 0.98), using the CLC Genomics Workbench v. 20 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gene expression levels were calculated as Transcripts Per Million (TPM), to allow a more reliable comparison both within and between samples ( [Wagner et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B93)), and represented as a heat map based on Log (TPM + 1) values.

### Real-Time Quantitative PCR Analyses

Adult _M. galloprovincialis_ with shells 8–10 cm in length were obtained from a commercial shellfish farm (Bacoli, Napoli, Italy). Three living adult animals were used for RNA extraction from different tissues. From each mussel, hemolymph was withdrawn from the adductor muscle of each mussel with a 0.5 mm diameter (25G) disposable needle. The hemolymph sampled at time zero was centrifuged at 4°C a 3000 _g_ for 10 min, and the pellet containing the hemocytes was resuspended in 350 μl of RTL buffer included in the RNasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) and stored at −80°C until RNA isolation.

To be consistent with RNA extraction, tissue samples from adductor muscle, gills, digestive gland, mantle edge, and foot were isolated from the same three animals that were used to isolate hemocytes and processed with the same kit. RNA integrity was estimated on a 1.0% agarose gel. Then, 500 ng of total RNA was retrotranscribed with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out with Applied Biosystems (Life Technologies) ViiA7 384 wells format. The absence of genomic DNA contamination was ensured thanks to two DNase treatments carried out during the RNA extraction and during the cDNA retro-transcription phases, respectively. Real-time qPCR reactions were performed with three biological replicates, and each of them with technical triplicates. Each reaction was performed in a final volume of 9 μL containing 5 μL of Fast SYBR Green Master Mix, 1 μL diluted cDNA (1:5), and 0.7 pmol/μL specific primers ( [Supplementary Table 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8)). The primers were specifically designed either on different exons or on exon/exon junctions to prevent the amplification of contaminant genomic DNA or to detect its presence through a melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplification efficiency of each primer pair was calculated using a dilution series of cDNA. Dissociation curves were carried out to ensure that primer pairs amplified single products with no detectable primer dimers. In addition, the expected size of each amplicon was verified by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis with GeneRuler 100 bp ladder (ThermoFisher) as a size marker. Expression levels were standardized to EF1α as a reference gene, and all the data were analyzed using 2–ΔΔCt Livak Method. We decided to use the expression of Dnmt1 in hemocytes as a baseline of expression level, so all the ΔΔCt values were calculated using the Dnmt1 ΔCt in hemocytes as a reference for each individual. Data shown are the average of the relative expression levels in all three animals.

## Results

### Identification of _Mytilus galloprovincialis_ DNA-Methylation Machinery Genes

In order to identify DNA-methylation genes in _M. galloprovincialis_, we employed a survey analysis by either extracting annotations from the mg10 version assembly, or by recovering full-length CDS from previous versions and/or transcriptome data (full details in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#T1) below).

TABLE 1

[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/698561/fevo-09-698561-HTML/image_m/fevo-09-698561-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/698561/fevo-09-698561-HTML/image_m/fevo-09-698561-t001.jpg)

**Table 1.** List of genes involved in the DNA-methylation machinery in _Mytilus galloprovincialis_, with gene ID (genome assembly version mg10), protein length, and GenBank accession ID.

These survey analyses revealed that _M. galloprovincialis_, compared with the reference human sequences, has:

(i) A single DNMT1 ortholog. The identified sequence displayed an unequivocal homology with human DNMT1, with 53% pairwise amino acid sequence identity, detectable from the N-terminal to the C-terminal end, and preservation of all expected conserved domains (see below).

(ii) A single DNMT3 ortholog. The mussel sequence, in this case, showed some remarkable structural differences compared with human, as it displayed a much longer N-terminal region (see below). Nevertheless, the alignable portion of the mussel sequence nearly entirely covered the full protein sequence of both human DNMT3 paralogs, with a slightly superior homology with DNMT3B than DNMT3A (35 vs. 33% identity).

(iii) A single TET ortholog. The BLAST alignment revealed a similar degree of similarity with the three human TET paralogs, which all share a very similar domain architecture (50.91% identity with TET1, 53.19% identity with TET2, and 56.48% identity with TET3), with significant homologies detected in the conserved C-terminal domain the protein (see below).

(iv) A single ortholog to MBD2/MBD3 with two variants, originated by a single gene by alternative splicing, that we called MBD2/3a and MBD2/3b. In this case, the level of sequence homology was very similar between the two human paralogs, with 48.81% identity with MBD2 and 50.00% identity with MBD3 at the amino acid level. Although both human sequences share the typical tripartite structure of MBD proteins (see below), human MBD2 is characterized by a N-terminal glycine-rich low complexity region, which was not detected in mussel, making the _M. galloprovincialis_ orthologs structurally slightly more similar to MBD3.

(v) A single MBD4 ortholog. In this case, just 24% of the mussel sequence could be aligned with human MBD4. However, the orthology relationship was made quite clear by the presence of two distinct regions of homology, corresponding to the MBD (57% sequence identity) and to the DNA glycosylase (71% sequence identity) domains, respectively.

No reliable ortholog sequence to the other human DNA methylation-related proteins could be identified in _M. galloprovincialis_. In particular, we did not find any orthologs for the MeCP2, considered the founding member of the MBD family of vertebrates. This observation was not surprising, considering that vertebrate MBD4 and MeCP2 are thought to derive from a lineage-specific gene duplication event that occurred several million years after the split between protostomes and deuterostomes and that MBD4 is thought to have maintained a structural organization closer to that of the ancestral protein. Hence, the MBD4 orthologs found in invertebrates have been often referred to as MBD4/MeCP2 ( [Albalat et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B3); [de Mendoza et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B20)).

Although our survey also allowed the identification of two DNMT2 orthologs in _M. galloprovincialis_ (one complete plus one partial gene), these sequences have not been subject to in-depth analyses in the present study due to their involvement in a different biological process, the methylation of aspartic acid tRNA.

### Mussel DNA Methylation Related Gene Structure

Next, we took advantage of the SPLIGN NCBI software,[1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#footnote1) in order to determine the exon-intron structure of genes of interest. By an accurate and fast alignment of the cDNA sequences against their genomic counterparts, we were able to define the number of exons of each gene and their organization, as shown in [Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F1).

FIGURE 1

[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/698561/fevo-09-698561-HTML/image_m/fevo-09-698561-g001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/698561/fevo-09-698561-HTML/image_m/fevo-09-698561-g001.jpg)

**Figure 1.** Exon-Intron structure of _M. galloprovincialis_ Dnmt1, Dnmt3, Tet, Mbd 2/3, and Mbd4 genes. The red square indicates the optional 39 bp region alternatively spliced in the exon 2 of the Mbd2/3 gene. The two different lengths refer to the Mbd2/3a and Mbd2/3b variants.

The mussel Dnmt1 gene contains 38 exons, 3 less than the human ortholog ( [Dabe et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B18)). The number of exons found in the _Mytilus_ Dnmt3 gene (22) was very similar to the human Dnmt3b gene (24 exons) and much higher than Dnmt3a (9 exons) ( [Lees-Murdock et al., 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B50)). The unique _M. galloprovincialis_ Tet gene contains a slightly lower number of exons than the three human paralogs, i.e., 10 vs. the 12-11-11 found in Tet 1-2-3, respectively (NCBI). The _Mytilus_ MBD2/3 gene has six exons, just one less than the human MBD2 and MBD3 genes (NCBI). Finally, the _M. galloprovincialis_ MBD4 gene was characterized by a much higher number of exons than the human ortholog, i.e., 21 vs. 8 (NCBI).

However, a pairwise comparison between the structure of mussel and human ortholog genes is complicated by the high phylogenetic divergence between protostomes and deuterostomes and by the consequent possible lineage-specific acquisition or loss of exons at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genes. A comprehensive comparative analysis of the structural organization of DNA methylation-related genes in protostomes goes beyond the scope of this manuscript, due to the impossibility of verifying the accuracy of genome assemblies and gene annotations of all species. Nevertheless, we briefly compared the architecture of _M. galloprovincialis_ genes with the ortholog sequences found in other lophotrochozoans (i.e., the bivalve _C. gigas_, gastropod mollusks belonging to the genus _Pomacea_ and the brachiopod _L. anatina_). This preliminary characterization pointed out that the number of coding exons and their boundaries remained relatively well conserved during evolution within the protein regions showing the highest homology and the presence of recognizable protein domains (see the section “Domain Architecture of _M. galloprovincialis_ DNA Methylation Toolkit Related Proteins”). On the other hand, exons of variable size, encoding highly divergent protein sequences were often found at the 5′ and 3′ ends of some target genes (most notably, DNMT3 and TET), suggesting that multiple independent gene architecture rearrangements might have happened in these regions in protostomes ( [Supplementary Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8)).

### Domain Architecture of _M. galloprovincialis_ DNA Methylation Toolkit Related Proteins

The structural comparison between the mussel sequences and those from human and from representative lophotrochozoan species were then extended at the protein level. To this aim we employed the pfam and interpro databases ( [Figures 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F2), [3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F3)). As previously mentioned, the _M. galloprovincialis_ DNMT1 contains the same highly conserved domains of the human protein ( [Jeltsch and Jurkowska, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B42); [Ren et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B74)), as well as of the ortholog sequences from most other Lophotrochozoans. These include the N-terminal DMAP1 domain (undetectable in _L. anatina_), which can bind the transcriptional co-repressor of the same name ( [Rountree et al., 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B79)). Mussel DNMT1 shows a replication foci domain (RFD) necessary for mediating the anchoring to the replication fork ( [Leonhardt et al., 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B51)), a zing finger CXXC motif able to bind unmethylated CpG ( [Pradhan et al., 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B69)) and two bromo-adjacent homology domains that may work in mediating protein–protein interaction necessary for mediating gene expression silencing. As expected, the C-terminal region contains a methylase domain (C5 cytosine methyltransferase), responsible for the catalytic activities on a cytosine residue in DNA sequence and transfer the methyl group from _S_-Adenosyl methionine to the 5′ position in the cytosine ring ( [Razin, 1989](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B73)). It is interesting to note that the correct orchestration of all these domains contributes to the allosteric regulation of DNMT1 activity on maintenance methylation ( [Jeltsch and Jurkowska, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B42)).

**Figure 3.** **(A)** Conserved domain organization of TET, MBD2/3, and MBD4 of _Mytilus galloprovincialis_ in comparison with those of _Crassostrea gigas_, _Lingula anatina_, and _Pomacea canaliculata_. The phylogenetically informative regions used for Bayesian inference are included in a red box. **(B)** List of the functional domains. For each protein the N-terminus is on the left and the C-terminus is on the right.

The domain architecture of the _Mytilus_ DNMT3 ( [Figure 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F2)) is also very similar to that of human DNMT3a and DNMT3b even though this protein includes a very long N-terminal region devoid of recognizable domains, which is encoded by exons that are not conserved across Lophotrochozoa ( [Supplementary Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8)). In brief, the sequence harbored three main domains. The most N-terminal domain, the Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP) domain, is required for DNMT3 chromatin association via recognition of Histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 36. This binding is necessary for directing the _de novo_ methylation activity at the pericentric heterochromatin ( [Chen et al., 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B17)). The central ADD domain binds to histone H3 unmethylated tails at lysine 4 ( [Zhang et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B101)). Similarly to DNMT1, the C-terminal domain is the C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase.

The unique _M. galloprovincialis_ TET protein has only a single well defined structural domain, i.e., the double-stranded β-helix 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase domain ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F3)). The function of this domain is to convert 5 methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ( [Tahiliani et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B89)), inducing demethylation or further oxidation to 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine ( [He et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B36)). Our analysis showed that the _Mytilus_ TET lacks the CXXC motif and the cysteine-rich domain that characterizes two of three mammalian TET ( [Nakajima and Kunimoto, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B62)). Like DNMT3, the mussel TET protein shows a long N-terminal region with no detectable domains, encoded by exons which are not conserved in different Lophotrochozoan species ( [Supplementary Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8)).

We then analyzed the methyl CpG binding domain proteins (MBD2/3 and MBD4). In _M. galloprovincialis_, both alternatively spliced isoforms of MBD2/3 generate similar proteins, which only differ by a 13 residues indel, which does not impair the overall tripartite structural organization. This consists of a typical N-terminal MBD domain, shared by all MBD proteins and by MeCP2, followed by a central domain which, in vertebrate MBD2, includes the transcriptional repressor domain (TRD) responsible for the recruitment of histone deacetylases, and by a C-terminal domain containing coiled-coil regions ( [Hendrich and Bird, 1998](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B37); [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F3)). It is, however, important to note that the precise localization of TRD in the mussel sequence would require additional functional characterization, since the transcriptional repression function is carried out by different non-homologous regions in different MBD family members ( [Boeke et al., 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B12)). Finally, MBD4 displayed a structural architecture similar to that of other metazoan orthologs, with a slight difference in the length of the N-terminal region, showing the presence of the characterizing MBD domain followed by a larger DNA glycosylase domain at the C-terminal end ( [Kondo et al., 2005](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B48)). The two domains are separated by a low complexity region significantly longer than human MBD4 ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F3)).

### The DNA-Methylation Machinery Is Conserved Across All Bivalves

The largely different sequencing strategies and computational approaches used to obtain the 23 bivalve genomes comparatively analyzed in this study resulted in genome assemblies with different quality and completeness, ranging from chromosome-scale ( [Ran et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B71); [Peng et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B66); [Wei et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B96)) to highly fragmented and partial drafts ( [Uliano-Silva et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B91)). Hence, the lack of detection of some of the genes involved in the DNA-methylation machinery in some of the target species does not necessarily imply the absence of a given gene, as several technical factors could explain these apparent gene losses.

In brief, we could recover evidence in support of the existence of Dnmt1, Dnmt3, Tet, Mbd2/3, and Mbd4 orthologs, either with a full CDS or with partial sequences, in all the species analyzed ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F4)). On the other hand, Tet could not be retrieved from _M. nervosa_ and _P. generosa_, two species with a relatively low assembly and annotation quality (i.e., with a high rate of fragmented and absent BUSCOs), which also lacked transcriptome data to fill-in such gaps. We can therefore hypothesize that such missed detections are unlikely to indicate the absence of Tet genes, but rather their inclusion in unassembled genomic regions. Moreover, the identification of Dnmt1, Dnmt3, Mbd2/3, Mbd4, and Tet orthologs in the transcriptomes available for three representative species belonging to the basal bivalve subclass Protobranchia further supports the high conservation of this system in bivalves. Overall, shorter sequences were more likely to be detected as complete or as nearly complete, as the consequence of their relatively simple gene structure ( [Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F1)) and exon computational annotation. Conversely, possibly owing to the very low expression level of Dnmt3 in adult tissues ( [Figures 6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F6), [7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F7)), this particular gene was often poorly annotated, and the encoded sequences could not be included in phylogenetic inference analysis.

**Figure 7.** Expression profiles of the Dnmt1, Dnmt3, Tet, Mbd2/3a-b, and Mbd4 in different _Mytilus galloprovincialis_ adult tissues.

In summary, while the presence of gene duplications among Dnmt and Mbd orthologs is not uncommon among Metazoa ( [Albalat et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B3)), all the genes involved in the DNA methylation machinery appear to be nearly invariably present with a single copy in bivalves ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F4)). The results we report are, for the most part, in line with the data recently reported by [Planques et al. (2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B67) in a large-scale comparative study among metazoans. However, we here clarify that the previously reported apparent lack of Dnmt3 in a few bivalve species was most likely a technical artifact linked with mis-assemblies or incorrect gene annotation.

### Evolutionary Analysis of Bivalve DNA Methylation Machinery Genes

Previous comparative studies on the genes involved in DNA methylation processes have only targeted a very few molluscan species with a fully sequenced genome, such as the owl limpet _Lottia gigantea_ ( [Albalat et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B3)). However, Mollusca is an extraordinarily large and diverse phylum, which includes over 43,000 recognized species adapted to marine, freshwater, and terrestrial life, and over 8000 bivalve species have been formally described to date ( [Rosenberg, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B78)). Therefore, the use of a single bivalve species as a representative for the entire class may not be appropriate to fully capture the high degree of morpho-ecological diversity of these organisms. Compared with previous studies, our comparative Bayesian inference approach allowed us to investigate with more depth the evolution of DNMT, TET, and MBD genes in bivalve species with complete genome sequence available.

In line with the rare occurrence of gene duplication and loss events, most genes involved in the bivalve DNA methylation machinery displayed sequence phylogenies nearly identical to the currently accepted species phylogeny ( [Figure 5A](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F5) and [Supplementary Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#S8)). As of note, the relatively high degree of inter-species sequence divergence, as well as the fragmentation of some of the ortholog genes identified, often reduced the phylogenetically informative regions that could be included in the MSA to a fraction of the full-length proteins ( [Figures 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F2)– [4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F4)).

Not surprisingly, this structural conservation of DNMT1 ( [Figure 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F2)) was mirrored by phylogenetic inference, which produced a well-supported clade for Mytilida sequences (posterior probability = 1) within an equally well-supported monophyletic Pteriomorphia clade. Overall, Bayesian phylogeny produced an unambiguous phylogeny, nearly devoid of taxonomic inconsistencies ( [Figure 5B](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F5)).

The phylogenetic reconstruction of DNMT3 evolution was complicated by the usually high degree of fragmentation of the annotated genes, which resulted in the exclusion of several species from the analysis ( [Figure 5C](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F5)). In any case, the topology of the tree was consistent with the expected species phylogeny, with mytilid sequences once again being placed in a monophyletic clade (posterior probability = 1).

As previously mentioned, bivalve TET proteins displayed a largely divergent N-terminal region and therefore the MSA was trimmed to include only the conserved C-terminal domain ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F3)). Overall, phylogenetic inference produced a gene tree highly consistent with the expected species tree, which strongly supported the monophyly of mytilid sequences ( [Figure 5D](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F5)).

Consistently with the similar length and structural organization of bivalve MBD2/3 orthologs ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F3)) the topology of the phylogenetic tree deriving from the full alignment of the protein sequences was well-consistent with the species tree ( [Figure 5E](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F5)).

The low levels of primary sequence homology of bivalve MBD4 led to the inclusion of just the relatively short C-terminal DNA glycosylase domain in the trimmed MSA ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F3)). Possibly owing to the relatively short length of the MSA, the phylogeny of MBD4 was the most problematic among all those studied in this work, as the tree was characterized by some discrepancies in the relative relationships among bivalve subclasses ( [Figure 5F](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F5)). In particular, Pteriomorphia was not identified as a monophyletic group, and the monophyly of sequences from the Mytilida clade was supported by a relatively low posterior probability (i.e., 0.68).

In summary, our phylogenetic investigations did not reveal any unexpected peculiarity in the evolution of the bivalve DNA methylation machinery. The few incongruences observed between gene trees and species trees came to no surprise due to the relatively short length of the MSAs analyzed, incomplete taxonomical sampling and the possibility of missing data linked with past gene duplication and loss events ( [Pamilo and Nei, 1988](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B64); [Maddison, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B60); [Nichols, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B63)). In general, the availability of additional genomic data from other bivalves would be expected to improve the topology of the trees obtained with this approach, likely resolving most of the incongruences between gene and species phylogeny.

### Expression of DNA Methylation-Related Genes in Bivalve Adult Tissues

Overall, the _in silico_ assessment of gene expression levels of DNA methylation-related genes in bivalve adult tissues revealed a poor transcriptional activity, seldom reaching values higher than 10 TPM and most often displaying values lower than 3 TPM, which is close to the arbitrary threshold generally used to define whether a transcript is expressed at biologically significant levels ( [Figure 6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F6)). The only exception was Mbd2/3, which displayed higher expression in all tissues, possibly due to the involvement of this gene in other processes, which are provided in vertebrates by the three paralogous genes Mbd1, Mbd2, and Mbd3 ( [Figure 6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F6)). _M. galloprovincialis_ was generally characterized by gene expression patterns in line with those of the other bivalve species analyzed for the available tissues, i.e., gills, posterior adductor muscle, anterior, mid and posterior mantle, hemocytes, and digestive gland ( [Figure 6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F6)). With the exception of MBD2/3 which, as mentioned above, was broadly expressed at values comprised between ∼8 TPM in mantle and ∼22 TPM in hemocytes, just a very few transcripts exceeded the threshold of 5 TPM: namely, Dnmt1 in the posterior adductor muscle (TPM = 9.34) and MBD4 in gills and posterior adductor muscle (14.15 and 25.48, respectively). Among the genes investigated, Dnmt3 emerged as the one displaying the lowest expression levels, in all adult tissues and all species, with the only notable exception represented by the foot of _A. marissinica_ (TPM = 24.34).

Although reproductive tissues were only available for two species ( _C. gigas_ and _M. yessoensis_), RNA-seq data suggests that Dnmt1, Mbd2/3, Mbd4, and Tet are expressed in both male and female gonads at levels comparable to other adult tissues. On the other hand, Dnmt3 maintained a poor expression in the gonads of _M. yessoensis_ (TPM < 1) and a moderate expression in the gonads of _C. gigas_ (TPM ∼5). As of note, gene expression levels in bivalve gonads are expected to undergo significant seasonal variations due to the gametogenic cycle ( [Banni et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B8)) and it is presently unknown whether and to which extent DNA methylation-related genes are affected by this factor.

In summary, RNA-seq data highlights that all DNA methylation related genes, except Mbd2/3, appear to be poorly expressed in the adult tissues of all bivalve species, including _M. galloprovincialis_.

We verified the expression of Dnmt1, Dnmt3, Tet, Mbd2/3a-b, and Mbd4 by qPCR in different _M. galloprovincialis_ adult tissues: hemocytes, mantle edge, foot, gills, digestive gland, and posterior adductor muscle. The results obtained mainly were consistent with RNA-seq data, confirming the very low expression of Dnmt1, Dnmt3, and Tet and the moderate expression of Mbd2/3 in all adult tissues ( [Figure 7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F7)). As a further confirmation of RNA-seq gene expression data, the adductor muscle and hemocytes were the two tissues characterized by the highest absolute expression levels in _M. galloprovincialis_ ( [Figure 7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F7)). The most significant discrepancy between the two approaches concerned Mbd4, which appeared to be strongly expressed in all tissues by qPCR, in contrast with the poor expression levels highlighted by RNA-seq in all tissues, except gills, and adductor muscle ( [Figures 6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F6), [7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#F7)). This inconsistency may be due to a number of different reasons, including the genetic variability between the animals that were subjected to the two types of analyses, their different age, the diverse geographical background and ecological parameters of sampling sites. Unfortunately, transcriptome data were not available for some _M. galloprovincialis_ tissues, which prevented further discussion concerning the expression of DNA methylation-related genes in the foot and, in particular, their seasonal regulation in reproductive tissues (that we carefully excluded from qPCR analyses by dissecting the mantle edge only).

## Discussion

Although DNA methylation is a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes, most of the studies on this subject in metazoans have so far targeted vertebrates and a few invertebrate models. To expand these investigations to marine bivalves, in this study we selected the Mediterranean mussel _M. galloprovincialis_ as a reference species, revealing for the first time a full complement of DNA methylation-related genes in its genome, comprising Dnmt1, Dnmt3, Tet, Mbd2/3, and Mbd4. We characterized the architecture of the mussel genes and the structural organization of the encoded proteins, revealing relatively good conservation of exon number and position, as well as of the key conserved domains with lophotrochozoan and human orthologs. Phylogenetic inference strongly supported the monophyletic origins of each of the five sequence groups, highlighting a high concordance between gene family trees and species taxonomy. The evolutionary analyses also revealed that no lineage-specific gene duplication events occurred in bivalves, and confirmed that only a single Mbd2/3 ortholog and a single Mbd4/MeCP2 ortholog (with high structural homology with Mbd4) are present in mollusks. Moreover, we investigated the expression profiles of all the genes involved in the DNA methylation machinery, using both RNA-seq and qPCR data, revealing that most of them (excluding Mbd2/3 and Mbd4) are expressed at poor levels in adult tissues. These results provide a framework to better understand how DNA methylation regulates several fundamental biological processes in marine bivalves, paving the way for future studies focused on the role of DNA methylation during early developmental stages. Indeed, while this process is well known to play a key role during mammalian development, its possible involvement in the reprogramming of the DNA methylome in gametes or during embryonic development in invertebrates, and mollusks in particular, is still poorly understood. Furthermore, despite the growing number of studies focused on this subject in mollusks, many aspects need to be further investigated. In oyster, as well as in other mollusks, DNA methylation seems to mostly occur with a mosaic distribution, with an alternation of hypermethylated (housekeeping genes) and hypomethylated (inducible genes) DNA regions ( [Fneich et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B27); [Wang et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B95); [Riviere et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B76); [Venkataraman et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B92)). Moreover, unlike vertebrates, where DNA methylation is more common in intergenic regions and regulatory elements, the distribution in mollusks appears to be predominant in the gene body ( [Gavery and Roberts, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B29); [Keller et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B46)). However, the mechanism by which gene body methylation can differentially regulate gene transcription remains to be elucidated. Moreover, the very recent discovery of DNA methylation occurring also in the promoters and in regions associated with transposable elements in _C. virginica_ highlights that the role of DNA methylation in bivalves is still not fully understood ( [Venkataraman et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.698561/full#B92)). In summary, this manuscript provides the first insights on the DNA methylation machinery genes in _M. galloprovincialis_, offering a unique opportunity for further in-depth investigations that should be aimed at clarifying the mechanisms underpinning DNA methylation and the functional role of this process in mollusks. Ultimately, additional studies will be necessary in the near future to better understand how the environment and emerging contaminants can influence DNA methylation patterns in bivalves, and how the induced environmental phenotypic plasticity, in which may be associated with new physiological responses and adaptation, can be inherited through generations.
