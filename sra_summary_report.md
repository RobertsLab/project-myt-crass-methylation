‚úÖ **In short:** This dataset is heavily focused on **Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas)** genomic methylation/epigenetic studies, primarily generated on **Illumina NovaSeq 6000** by a handful of groups (notably Ifremer and Ocean University of China). Data volumes per experiment are large (5‚Äì18 GB), with most libraries sequenced via **Bisulfite-Seq** for DNA methylation and some **ATAC-seq** for chromatin accessibility.
